    "commentary": "The wise value the good qualities described as Daivisampat and try to cultivate them in their life. Opposed to this, men of demonical nature embrace the wicked qualities mentioned in this verse. That is why they are spoken of as\nAsurasamapat\n. Really speaking, the demonical state is not sampat (treasure) at all. And yet people are so deluded that they hug these wicked qualities and think of themselves as great men. The Lord mentions six qualities of the demonical nature. They are elaborately discussed in this discourse. In the great war with Maya, it is necessary to know and understand the power of the enemy forces as well as the forces of one’s own. Only then it would be possible to wage successful war with the enemy. If anybody wants to live in a house, he should first of all clean it of the dust, cobwebs and other foul things, and then light some scented sticks to purify the atmosphere. So also, man should keep the body pure, the foul things in it should be ejected and nourishing food should be taken in. In the same manner, purity of mind should be cultivated by abandoning the bad qualities which have been possessing the heart for a long time in one’s ignorant state. The removal of vicious taints from nature and the formation of healthy patterns of character and conduct, is the duty of all men.",

    "translation": "The divine treasures are said to be for the purpose of liberation, and the heritage of the demons, for bondage. Grieve not, Ο Pāndava; you are born with divine treasures.",
    "commentary": "Having described the divine and demonical nature, the Lord now declares the fruits of each. When a man knows the effects of the things, he is induced to accept things, which yield good results and abandon others which yield bad results. Divine nature leads to liberation, the demonical leads to bondage. The two natures function in opposite directions and yield opposite results. One liberates and the other binds, enslaves. The thoughtful know what to choose, between freedom and slavery. No one wants pain and suffering, ignorance and darkness, slavery and bondage. Therefore it is our duty to dispel darkness with light, to remove ignorance with knowledge, and to crush demonical nature with divine.\nThese two hostile natures, the divine and the demonical are not racial or national or family qualities. After a man is born, these two natures develop gradually in him. By right type of control, guidance and training, the mind falls into the groove of divine qualities, and then it attains the highest rewards of self-realisation. On the other hand, if the mind falls into the wrong groove, it acquires all evil qualities and the man falls into lower planes of life. Arjuna is assured by the Lord Himself, that he is born for divine nature and full of divine qualities. Otherwise, how could he receive the supreme truth directly from the lips of the Lord Himself?\nMa suchah:\n‘Do not grieve.’ This is the Gita message, simple, straight, direct and decisive. “O Arjuna! you are born for the divine nature and therefore, do not grieve.” From this, it is clear that the cultivation of good qualities, purity of mind, is the way to peace and bliss. It is also clear that the demonical nature is the cause of sorrow, misery and death. Therefore the aspirants for spiritual light should strive for divine nature and resolutely abandon the demonical impulses.\nThe stronger terms\nvimokshaya\nand\nnibandhaya\nare used here to suggest that the Divine liberates completely and the Demonical binds fast.",

The Aryans and non-Aryans are divided distinctly by the qualities, which they exhibit. All other distinctions of races and creeds are subsequent divisions brought about by men, by geographical and other external considerations. Whatever may be the birth of man, the field of the Divine is open for all to enter by the practice of the blessed qualities described by the Lord in daivisampat.\nBhagavad Gita: Chapter 16 🔻 (24 Verses)\n01\n02\n03\n04\n05\n06\n07\n08\n09\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24",

These are the worst type of men. The middle type listen to advice and try to refrain themselves. The highest type are already on the Divine path. Here two words Pravritti and Nivritti are used.\nPravritti means what should be done and Nivritti means what should not be done.\nThe wise man should know both.

Desire is to be conquered by dispassion, wrath by love, greed by discrimination and detachment.

    "commentary": "So long as the triple evil of desire, anger, and greed poison the heart of man, he cannot do any good. He cannot accomplish his own well-being. Therefore man should first purify his heart by reducing and eliminating these corrosive evils. Then he spontaneously rises to higher planes of spiritual life and attains Moksha. Like the sun and moon freed from the darkening grip of Rahu and Ketu, like the Gajendra freed from the death hold of the crocodile (Makara), like the prisoner brought out into the sunlight from the darkness of the prison-cell, the Jiva should liberate himself from the strange-hold of those three evils. He should become vimuktah (i.e) completely free from them. The idea is that there should not be any trace of these evils anywhere in the mind. They are the gateways of darkness (i.e) they are forms of ignorance (avidya) where there is no gleam of light, where everything is plunged in darkness. Such a man is like one living in a closed house full of darkness. He lives in sorrow and perishes in sorrow.\nAcharatyatmanah sreyah:\nThe well-being of self requires thoughtful discrimination of the real and the unreal. What is this life? What is the world? What is the end and aim of life? These questions arise in the mind of the sattvic man who is partially awakened to find out the truth. But the man who is possessed by lust, anger and greed, cannot think of these things at all, because his whole mind is absorbed in sensual cravings, is agitated by anger, and confounded by inordinate greed. So, the seeker should keep away from these evils and that is in itself the great good that man can do unto himself. For, where these evils are not, the mind is pure, and when the mind is pure, he enjoys bliss of the Self.\nParam gatim:\nMoksha is the highest goal and there is no state higher than that. It is implied that the lowest state is that of demonical ignorance resulting in Kama and Krodha.",

This is wrong. It is only a mask to cover up their own unbridled passions and evil desires. They deny the authority of the Sastras, because they are deluded by ignorance and agitated by sensual desires. The Sastras embody the laws of life both secular and spiritual, which have been discovered after long research into the meaning and purpose of human life by the greatest of men, the Rishis, whose only aim was the welfare of humanity. They stated the laws following which man attains the best things in secular life and the highest goal in spiritual life. So, every true seeker should test his way of life, his thoughts, feelings and actions by referring them to the scriptural laws. Where they do not conform to the Sastras, they should be checked and restrained, and right methods should be adopted. The Lord declares that no good can be achieved by acting contrary to the commands of the Sastras, because the Sastras express the will of God. So, the seekers should carefully study the Sastras and mould their life accordingly, so that they can secure both worldly happiness and spiritual realisation.",
