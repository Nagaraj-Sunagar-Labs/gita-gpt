    "translation": "Above and below spread its branches, nourished by the gunas. Sense-objects are its buds; and its clustering roots spread downward in the world of men, giving rise to action.",
    "commentary": "The tree of samsara is vividly described here. It is not a small tree. It has grown strong and firm from millions of births, and has deeply established its roots in the world. Its branches spread upto Brahma loka. Its roots are the past samskaras of action. The three Gunas are its branches. Its tender shoots grow by enjoyment of sense-objects. How then to cut this mighty tree? The branches should be struck by purifying the mind of the three Gunas; the tender shoots should be cut by dispassion towards sense-enjoyments; and the roots should be destroyed by removing the past tendencies of the mind. As all trees are sustained by their roots, this tree of samsara is sustained by deeply impregnated ‘samskaras’ or ‘vasanas’, and when they are destroyed, the whole tree falls to the ground being struck at the roots. It is there that the operation should be conducted. When the roots are cut, the branches, shoots and buds wither away in a short time. The wise man therefore should cultivate dispassion (vairagya) towards sense-objects. Dispassion brings about the cessation of the impulses and urgings of action. Where there is no action, there is no bondage, resulting from Karma. If, on the other hand, man nurtures the vasanas with raga and dvesha, he can never cut the tree and gain his freedom. He will be bound to samsara almost endlessly.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda\nCommentary by Swami Shuddhidananda\n“I saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story. From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned and winked. One fig was a husband and a happy home and children, and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor, and another fig was Ee Gee, the amazing editor, and another fig was Europe and Africa and South America, and another fig was Constantin and Socrates and Attila and a pack of other lovers with queer names and offbeat professions, and another fig was an Olympic lady crew champion, and beyond and above these figs were many more figs I couldn’t quite make out. I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn’t make up my mind which of the figs I would choose. I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet.”\n― Sylvia Plath, The Bell Jar",

    "translation": "Its true form is not comprehended here, nor its end, nor its origin, nor even its existence. Having cut down this firm-rooted Aśvattha with the strong axe of detachment, one should pray, “I take refuge in that Primal Being from whom has streamed forth this eternal activity,” and seek that Goal from which they who have reached it never return.",
    "commentary": "This tree of Samsara is not seen by man in the form described in the first and second verses. Why? Attached to Samsara, the ignorant do not see it as such. They do not see its beginning or end, or its present state of existence. They have not made any attempt to enquire into its real nature. They are immersed in the flood of Samsara and do not really know what it is, how it has come, and what its nature is etc. In darkness, the real nature of objects cannot be seen. Thus people live in Samsara and die in Samsara without understanding its true nature. This is Maya. Only a few awakened souls try to release themselves from its bondage, and among them only a few are able to cut the bond and attain liberation. The idea is that the darkness of ignorance is such that man is not able to realise the slavery and bondage which Samsara has imposed on him from time immemorial.\nThis tree of Samsara is described as ‘\nsuvirudhamulam\n‘ with roots deeply and firmly fixed in the world, and it has spread its branches far and wide, even upto Brahma loka. But its firmness and strength need not frighten us. Provided the weapon is sufficiently sharp and powerful, any tree can be felled to the ground. The Lord shows the weapon with which this tree can be cut. It is ‘asanga sastram’ Non-attachment to  world, and its sensual attractions and temptations is the axe which cuts the tree of Samsara. In other words, it is dispassion (vairagya). What a wonderful weapon to smash the tree of samsara! But the axe should be sharp and strong. Lukewarm and fitful vairagya (manda vairagya) is not enough. It should be blazing, burning, all-consuming ‘vairagya’. How else can this mighty tree be cut? That is why the Lord uses the word ‘dridhena’ as attribute to ‘asanga sastra’, This axe of dispassion cuts the very root of the tree and there is no more delusion or bondage. It is like destroying the main wheel of a huge factory-machine. When the main wheel is stopped, all the innumerable smaller wheels stop automatically. We need not stop every small wheel. So also, when the roots of the tree are cut, the branches, the buds and all other things wither away of their own accord. This non-attachment should be both external and internal.\nBut the aim is yet to be realised. Vairagya eliminates the obstacles on the path of Self realisation. Having given up the ‘\ndrisya\n‘, the objective world, the next step is to hold fast to the ‘\nDrik\n‘ the seer. This is important. It is not enough to clear the debts; one should acquire property, and then only he will be safe. The rejection of the sense-world is like clearing the debts. So along with ‘vairagya’ the seeker should possess jnana, knowledge of Paramatma. He should know that his real nature is Atma. Then his bliss is full and unhindered. That is why the Lord teaches That is then, the Atma is to be searched for (parimargitavyayam).\nThis is the highest state for a human being, because, having once attained it, man does not return to samsara again (\nna nivartanti bhuyah\n). It is the law that man has to return to this world again and again whatever world he goes to by his good work until he realises Paramatma. That wise attain it and are forever at rest.\nThe path to take for this search for the highest Truth is clearly stated here. The secret is revealed-“tam eva purusham prapadye”-“I take refuge in that Purusha alone.” This is the spirit prompting the aspirant in his search for Paramatma. It is a deeply devotional attitude, a surrender unto the Lord in the search for Atma. To him who has pure devotion, Brahma-jnana is easily attained.\nBhagavad Gita 15.3 to 15.4 by Swami Chetanananda\nBhagavad Gita 15.3 by Swami Shuddhidananda\nBhagavad Gita 15.4 by Swami Shuddhidananda\nDifference between Mukhya Bhakti and Para Bhakti\nAshvattha\nis\nVishvarupa\nwhich has its root in\nSaguna Brahman\nor\nAkshara\n. At the last stage one should have Vairagya and cut up this personal God who defies the mind to rise to higher unity as in the case of Sri Ramakrishna. This is the final obstacle in the path of spiritual life and it is here that even the highest Bhaktas like the dualistic devotees stop as they refuse to consider anything superior to this devotion. The only difference between the two Mukhya Bhakti and Para Bhakti may be noted as the realisation of unity as the highest Truth. The first shloka says that the ordinary वेदवित् rises in realization only up to the stage of knowing Akshara and worship of Akshara.\nFrom\n‘Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna’\n—\nThe teacher and the disciple repaired to the meditation room near by. Totapuri began to impart to Sri Ramakrishna the great truths of Vedanta.\n“Brahman”, he said, “is the only Reality, ever pure, ever illumined, ever free, beyond the limits of time, space, and causation. Though apparently divided by names and forms through the inscrutable power of maya, that enchantress who makes the impossible possible, Brahman is really One and undivided. When a seeker merges in the beatitude of samadhi, he does not perceive time and space or name and form, the offspring of maya. Whatever is within the domain of maya is unreal. Give it up. Destroy the prison-house of name and form and rush out of it with the strength of a lion. Dive deep in search of the Self and realise It through samadhi. You will find the world of name and form vanishing into void, and the puny ego dissolving in Brahman-Consciousness. You will realise your identity with Brahman, Existence-Knowledge-Bliss Absolute.” Quoting the Upanishad, Totapuri said: “That knowledge is shallow by which one sees or hears or knows another. What is shallow is worthless and can never give real felicity. But the Knowledge by which one does not see another or hear another or know another, which is beyond duality, is great, and through such Knowledge one attains the Infinite Bliss. How can the mind and senses grasp That which shines in the heart of all as the Eternal Subject?”\nTotapuri asked the disciple to withdraw his mind from all objects of the relative world, including the gods and goddesses, and to concentrate on the Absolute. But the task was not easy even for Sri Ramakrishna. He found it impossible to take his mind beyond Kali, the Divine Mother of the Universe. “After the initiation”, Sri Ramakrishna once said, describing the event, “Nangta began to teach me the various conclusions of the Advaita Vedanta and asked me to withdraw the mind completely from all objects and dive deep into the Atman. But in spite of all my attempts I could not altogether cross the realm of name and form and bring my mind to the unconditioned state. I had no difficulty in taking the mind from all the objects of the world. But the radiant and too familiar figure of the Blissful Mother, the Embodiment of the essence of Pure Consciousness, appeared before me as a living reality. Her bewitching smile prevented me from passing into the Great Beyond. Again and again I tried, but She stood in my way every time. In despair I said to Nangta: ‘It is hopeless. I cannot raise my mind to the unconditioned state and come face to face with Atman.’ He grew excited and sharply said: ‘What? You can’t do it? But you have to.’ He cast his eyes around. Finding a piece of glass he took it up and stuck it between my eyebrows. ‘Concentrate the mind on this point!’ he thundered.\nThen with stern determination I again sat to meditate. As soon as the gracious form of the Divine Mother appeared before me, I used my discrimination as a sword and with it clove Her in two. The last barrier fell. My spirit at once soared beyond the relative plane and I lost myself in samadhi.\n”\nSri Ramakrishna remained completely absorbed in samadhi for three days. “Is it really true?” Totapuri cried out in astonishment. “Is it possible that he has attained in a single day what it took me forty years of strenuous practice to achieve? Great God! It is nothing short of a miracle!” With the help of Totapuri, Sri Ramakrishna’s mind finally came down to the relative plane.\nSwami Vivekananda Says —\nCut down the banyan tree of desire with the axe of non-attachment, and it will vanish utterly.\nIt is all illusion. “He from whom blight and delusion have fallen, he who has conquered the evils of association, he alone is\nāzād\n(free)..”\n[Source]\nSwami Turiyananda:\nConstant discrimination sharpens the intellect. Truth reveals itself to a man who is always discriminating to attain it. One must always keep the sword of discrimination ready at hand. The Lord says in the Gitâ that we must cut down the deep-rooted Ashwattha (of Samsâra or the relative world) with the sword of non-attachment, and seek to enter that blessed state from which there is no return.

    "commentary": "In this verse, the qualities of the wise who attain the non-returning state Moksha, are clearly described. Six qualities are mentioned\n(1) Freedom from pride (ahamkara) and delusion,\n(2) Conquest of the evil of attachment to the sense-world. ‘Sanga’ is attachment; it is evil. This evil should be given up by detachment and dispassion.\n(3)\nadhyatmanityah\n:\nDwelling constantly in the Self. Here the word ‘\nnitya\n‘ is to be noted. Constant memory and understanding are necessary. At first, the seeker spends some time in Atma nishta and then he comes out into the objective world. This period of Self-centred meditation should be extended gradually till he is firmly established in the Self always. Constancy is emphasised many times by the Lord, because ‘avidya’ overtakes man the moment when he forgets Atma. To forget Atma is itself ‘Avidya’. So, constancy is prescribed as a rule for the seekers. We come across three types of men in the world. The first and the highest are those who are constantly in contact with Self; the second are those who contemplate Atma for some time, and then go into worldly activities; and the third are those who remain immersed in worldly life always. The second type have the opportunity of rising to the highest state. The third type of people are the lowest and most miserable. They are plunged in ignorance and totally devoid of any enlightenment what-so-ever.\n4)",

    "commentary": "The Sun, Moon and Fire illumine the material objects. The eye illumines the Sun; and the buddhi (intellect) illumines the eye; and Atma illumines the intellect (buddhi). So the whole universe including the shining objects like the Sun and the Moon, are illumined by perceiving senses and the intellect, which receive their light ultimately from Atma. So Atma is the light that illumines everything. All other things shine by the reflected light of Atma. In the Mundakopanishad this is clearly explained and proved (\nNa tatra suryo bhati\n).\nYad gatva na nivartante:\nThose who have reached the state of Atma do not again fall into the miserable pit of Samsara. From any other world in the universe, man has to return and take birth again. They have not the power to end sorrow. Only Paramatma has that power. The blessed state of Self-realisation, full of bliss, is Moksha. The same idea has been expressed in the previous verse also. (\nYasmin gata na nivartanti bhuyah)\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda\nCommentary by Swami Shuddhidananda\nतद्धाम परमं is reference to परमात्मा as distinct from अक्षर which is objective referred to as तद्धाम परमं मम of\nVIII.21\n, the अक्षर is above अव्यक्त, but परमात्मा is above अक्षर as it includes both subject and object, Jiva as well as God. This is unadulterated by any sensual colouring or unaffected by mental imaginations, as this is beyond senses and mind, neither सगुण साकार nor सगुण निराकार, but निर्गुण beyond the senses.\nFrom ‘Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna’ —\nMASTER:\n“A man attains Brahmajnana as soon as his mind is annihilated. With the annihilation of the mind dies the ego, which says ‘I’, ‘I’. One also attains the Knowledge of Brahman by following the path of devotion. One also attains It by following the path of knowledge, that is to say, discrimination. The jnanis discriminate, saying, ‘Neti, neti’, that is, ‘All this is illusory, like a dream.’ They analyse the world through the process of ‘Not this, not this’; it is maya. When the world vanishes, only the jivas, that is to say, so many egos, remain.\n“Each ego may be likened to a pot. Suppose there are ten pots filled with water, and the sun is reflected in them. How many suns do you see?”\nA DEVOTEE:\n“Ten reflections. Besides, there certainly exists the real sun.”\nMASTER:\n“Suppose you break one pot. How many suns do you see now?”\nDEVOTEE:\n“Nine reflected suns. But there certainly exists the real Sun.”\nMASTER:\n“All right. Suppose you break nine pots. How many suns do you see now?”\nDEVOTEE:\n“One reflected sun. But there certainly exists the real sun.”\nMASTER (\nto Girish\n):\n“What remains when the last pot is broken?”\nGIRISH:\n“That real sun, sir.”\nMASTER:\n“No. What remains cannot be described.

    "translation": "When the lord acquires a body, and when he leaves it, he takes these with him and goes on his way, as the wind carries away the scents from their places.",
    "commentary": "As the Jiva leaves one body and takes another, like one dropping old clothes and wearing new clothes, it is clear that he is not the body at all. Therefore this body-identification (dehatma-buddhi) should be given up once and for all. ‘I am Atma’ is the Mahamantra.\nMoreover, the word Isvara (Lord) is used with reference to Jivatma. The Jiva in truth is the Lord of the senses, the mind, and the body and all that pertains to it. He is the master and not the slave and bondman as he is now thinking and behaving. What a fall is there – from the state of the supreme ruler to the humiliating state of a servant! This is what has happened to man. He, the ruler, has no freedom or will of his own. He has to behave according to the dictates of the mind and the senses. He has reduced himself to this wretched position, by gross ignorance. “So, give up the slavery. Awake, arise and affirm your real nature? Thou art Paramatma!” This is the trumpet call of Lord Krishna to all mankind.\nGrihitvaitani samyati:\nIt is said here that the jiva when he leaves one body and obtains another, takes the mind and the senses (the vasanas) with him. He cannot take anything else with him, neither his house nor his relations and friends. They are all dropped off in the world. But what does he really take with him? He takes the mind and the five senses in the form of (vasanas), tendencies and predispositions. These determine the nature of the next birth. If these are pure, naturally the jiva is born to pure parents and enjoy a pure life. If these are impure, he is born to impure and sinful wombs, be the wombs of beasts, birds or reptiles. So one’s may future life is in his own hands. He should therefore take to spiritual sadhana even now immediately and escape from the miserable fate of being born as beasts and reptiles hereafter.\nThese ‘vasanas’ are the only provision for the journey of the Jiva to other worlds and bodies. Nothing else can he take from here. Nothing else can be of help to him. Nothing else follows him. They cannot even if they wish to. The journey is alone and lonely. But there is no fear, for, the good that he has done and the spiritual sadhana that he has performed will be with him. The mind carries the essence of his whole life, embedded in it in subtle form. It is his body-guard in his journey. So people are themselves the makers of their future birth, good or bad or birthlessness. The last is the goal, for, it is the state of Paramatma. The wise attain it by Brahma Jnana.\nVayur gandhanivasayati\n: This simile is used to illustrate the idea of the Jiva carrying the mind and senses with him at the time of birth and death. The wind carries all kinds of scents sweet or foul, from all kinds of objects. From flowers, sweet fragrance, from flesh, foul odour, the wind carries by absorbing the subtle essence of those objects. The wind has no likes or dislikes towards these sweet and foul scents. As the message-bearer carries good and bad news, as the wind blows sweet or foul as the case may be the jiva carries this essence of his whole life, in the subtle form of ‘vasanas’ and enters a new body. The body taken depends on the quality of the mind which the jiva is carrying. If it is impure, he goes into impure wombs, if it is pure, he enters enlightened wombs. Therefore, there is no partiality for God or the Divinities of Karma in the transmigration of the jiva. If the mind becomes so pure as to be rid of all ‘vasanas’, there is no further birth for the jiva. He attains union with Paramatma even here. So it is the primary duty of every seeker to purify the mind and the senses by constant sadhana. Thus they shall attain purer birth, and even Brahmajnana here and now.\nCommentary by Swami Shuddhidananda\nBhagavad Gita 15.8 to 15.11 by Swami Chetanananda\nKundalini, the repository of accumulated past impressions; how these impressions are wiped out.\nThe yogis and sages of the East, especially of India, say that good and bad thoughts do not merely leave their marks on the brain: They become transformed into an impelling subtle force that engages you in good or bad actions in the future. This force remains eternally at the base of the tailbone, the basic centre of kundalini, which is called muladhara. This is the dwelling place of the motivating powers that accumulate birth after birth, which are called samskaras, or past impressions. Samskaras can be destroyed only through the realization of God or the achievement of nirvikalpa samadhi. Otherwise, when an individual soul moves from one body to another, it carries that bundle of impressions as “the wind carries scents from place to place.” (Source: Sri Ramakrishna and His Divine Play)",

Therefore, the experience of the mind and the senses, do not really pertain to the jivatma. He wears these vehicles for the purpose of enjoying the objects of the sense-world.

In his very body tenanted by the jiva, who is eating, drinking sleeping, acting, enjoying and suffering, that Paramatman can be seen by right discrimination which opens the eye of knowledge (Jnanachakshushah). On account of the dominating of the objective phenomena, the deluded are not able to see Him. If he turns the mind outside, the world is reflected in it; If he turns it inside God is realised. If the mirror is turned to us, we see ourselves. If it is turned outside, the whole of the phenomenal world is seen. If the mind is turned within, kept calm, pure and firm, Atma is beheld. This Atma is seen only by such sages who can discriminate between the real and the unreal, the seer and the seen. (Seeing the Atma means, self-realisation.)",

    "translation": "Those who strive, armed with yoga, behold him dwelling within themselves; but the undisciplined and the thoughtless do not perceive him, though they strive.",
    "commentary": "The Lord explains why some yogis are able to behold the Atma, whereas others fail in their efforts. The effort is common in both cases. Why should some succeed and others fail? The impure-minded people (\nakritatmah\n) do not see the Atma, in spite of their sadhana. These also do japa, dhyana and other practices, but they fail because the heart is impure, (i.e. vitiated by powerful vasanas binding them to the external world). Some people attempt to realise Atma by a Study of sastras, without eradicating the impurities of the heart. Some others carry on a show of external devotion and meditation. They do not possess real self-control, and so they fail in their search for Paramatma. We hear that the Lord insists on purity of heart as the essential condition for Atmajnana. If there is no Purity, there is no Atmajnana. When Purity is attained, Atma is realised. The path is clear.\nThe field should be cleared of rubbish, properly tilled and watered and then the seeds grow and the harvest is gathered. Otherwise, the seeds are buried in the earth and have no chance of sprouting into life. They are wasted, for no harvest is gathered from that untilled, unwatered field (\nkshetram\n).\nThe four elementary principles of sadhana (\nsadhana chatushtaya\n) should be cultivated first. The heart is then purified of its unholy desires, passions, and emotions. The bodily organs and the sense organs and the mind are brought under control. When these disturbing forces are kept under check, the mind is full of peace and in that state, the enquiry into the Self continues without any hindrance and Self-realisation easily possible.\nThe Lord makes it clear that two things are needed (1) Effort, (2) Purity. ‘Yatantah’ – the yogis strive to discover the truth, Atma. The striving must be there for Self-realisation. Without it, nothing can be gained. But this striving should be accompanied with Purity (Chita-suddhi). Then the reward is immediate. The word ‘\nachetasah\n‘ does not here refer to illiterate, ignorant men who have no idea of spiritual life at all. It refers to persons who have some ideas of spirituality, who believe in God, who have studied the Sastras, and who understand the truth intellectually. These qualifications are good no doubt, but they are not enough for direct Self-realisation. They have to acquire self-control and dispassion (vairagya); otherwise, there is no progress. If the seekers do a bit of self-examination, they will find out how strong the bonds are which bind them to the objective world, and how weak their vairagya is. Let them concentrate on how to purify the heart of all its impure sensual tendencies. The company of the wise, the correct way of Sadhana, faith in the words of the Lord, all these are necessary for the aspirant to reach the goal.\nCommentary by Swami Shuddhidananda\nSwami Turiyananda: “As a bird flies to the sky with its two wings, so we must have the two wings of discrimina-tion and renunciation to climb to the edifice of liberation. If one has real discrimination and renunciation, one is safe. A man runs after water in a mirage only so long as he mistakes the mirage for real water. Once the delusion is broken, nobody goes after a mirage for water. The truth about it is that he only escapes whom the Mother Herself holds by the hand. Shri Ramakrishna used to say, ‘A finger-print is clear when the ink is all right, and if it is bad the impression also is bad.’ Spiritual instructions make a lasting impression on the mind that possesses discrimination and renunciation; and when there is a deficiency in these, the impression produced is proportionately small.” ….\n“Nothing drops from the skies all of a sudden. Why don’t all have concentration? Because they don’t fulfil the conditions necessary for it, viz., absolute continence. This is known as strength. What can you expect of one who lacks this strength? The long and short of it is that one must have full self-control. The Gitâ says, ‘In My opinion Yoga is impossible for one who has no self-control. But one who has controlled his senses may, if he tries, get at it by adopting the proper means.’\n“People follow their own whims and fail to get good results. The scriptures are there; but they won’t look into them. Nor would they listen to the teacher. In the end they become unfit for Yoga. ‘One who is moderate in food and pastime, in his effort for work, and in sleep and wakefulness-for such a man Yoga puts an end to all miseries.’\n“If one has some disease, it will pass off; but one must keep his spiritual practices going.” (Source: Spiritual Talks by the First Disciples of Sri Ramakrishna)",

Their existence depends on His existence. Apart from Him nothing exists. He is Existence Absolute. In Him exists this manifoldness particularized by names and forms as various objects-as Hari, Râma, the sun, the moon, etc. Because He exists, these depending on Him exist. He is Existence-Knowledge-Bliss Absolute. If exist-ence has no knowledge it is no existence at all. What is Existence is knowledge. Again, where there are existence and knowledge, there is bliss also. For what is misery? It is the absence of real knowledge. So where there is knowledge there is no misery but bliss.” (Source: Spiritual Talks by the First Disciples of Sri Ramakrishna)",

The ignorant may ascribe that energy to themselves, but the wise know that it is all the Lord’s inexhaustible power exhibiting through the multitudinous begins of the universe. From this declaration of the Lord, we come to know that Sri Krishna, the Charioteer of Arjuna, is not simply the child of Devaki (a little ‘upadhi’ like innumerable other beings), but the all-pervading, all-supporting Paramatma. Moreover, the food one eats is nourished by the Lord’s energy, permeating the world. Without Him, there would be no food for man. So when man feeds himself he should remember the Lord from whom the food has come to him. He is the mightiest producer and also distributor. He is the giver of the food. Should we not be grateful to Lord? Should we not offer to the Lord what belongs to Him? Eating is not animal-activity, but divine work, if one knows the secret of the Lord’s indivisible hand in its production. So also, if the light of the sun and the moon is not there, the universe would be plunged in darkness. It is the light of Paramatma that shines through the Sun, Moon and Fire.

    "translation": "As the fire Vaishvānara I enter into the bodies of all living creatures, and mingling with the upward and downward breaths, I digest the four kinds of food.",
    "commentary": "In the previous\nverse\n, the Lord said that He produces the food by his energy (sakti) and that He is the supporter and nourisher of all beings. Not only does the Lord produce food, He is also the digestive energy in all living beings. The body is built by food, and the food eaten should be properly digested before it turns into blood and vital energy. The digestive Fire (\nJatharagni\n) is the Lord Himself in the form of\nvaisvanara\n. So the Lord is the Creator as well as the nourisher of the body. In this way, man is wholly the product of the Lord and all the energy which he possesses comes to him from the Lord. He who eats the food without offering to the Lord is a thief, misappropriating to himself what is not really his (\nyo bhunkte stena eva saha\n3.12). That is why there is the\nsadachara\nin the world of offering food to God as\nnaivedyam\nbefore eating. What is eaten without such an offering is impure food. So everyone should offer his food first to God, and then a part of it to other hungry beings, and eat only the rest of it with Godly feelings. Then the very act of eating would become a yajna, and the food taken becomes nectar (Amritam).\nPraninam deham asritah:\nThe Lord is in the body, very near, nay, nearest to him. Realising His presence with him one should live a pure, blissful and blessed life.\nPachamyannam chaturvidham:\nThe four-fold food (1) Bhakshyam-Food which has been eaten by mastication, (2) Bhojyam -Soft food which has to be sucked in, (3) Lehyam -that which has to be licked. (4) Choshyam -that which has to be swallowed.\nOne can imagine how cautious he should be when he knows that the Lord is Himself the eater and the digester of food. Regulation of food habits is a necessary prerequisite of spiritual life. The body is the instrument of yoga sadhana, and food builds the body and sustains it. So everyone should practice restraint and moderation in this matter. The following principles should be observed (1) He should not eat too much (2) Sattivic food alone should be taken, Rajasic and Tamasic food should be avoided (vide 17-8, 9, 10 verses for a definition of the Sattvic, rajasic and tamasic, types of food). (3) The food taken should first be offered to the Lord. (4) The food should be earned by righteous means.\nIt is certainly better to live on roots and leaves obtained by righteous means than on luxurious dishes got by cheating, stealth and other unrighteous (adharmic) ways. The Lord is observing from within every morsel that one eats. The law of moderation has already been enunciated by the Lord (\nYuktaharaviharasya\n6.17).\nAs the Chapter deals with food it has become sadachara to recite it collectively or separately at the time of eating. In Asramas, Matts and houses, this practice is followed by most people. Food eaten in this spirit is a real offering to the Lord. He accepts it. Besides, such food permeates every particle of the body with divine purity and energy. Generally after reciting this Discourse, the wise take water in their palm, repeat the 24th verse in the IV Chapter (\nBrahmarpanam brahmahavir\n) sprinkle the water on the food, and then start eating. This is Brahma Karma Samadhi.\nCommentary by Swami Shuddhidananda\nSri Ramakrishna Says —\nKedar sang several other songs. After the music the Master again talked to the devotees. Nandalal, Keshab’s nephew, was also present with a few Brahmo friends. They were sitting near the Master.\nMASTER (\nto Vijay and the other devotees\n):\n“A man brought a bottle of consecrated wine for me; but I couldn’t even touch it.”\nVIJAY:\n“Ah!”\nMASTER:\n“I become intoxicated at the mere thought of God. I don’t have to take any wine. I feel drunk at the very sight of the charanamrita.\n5\nI feel as if I had drunk five bottles of liquor. When a person attains such a state he cannot help discriminating about food.”\nNARENDRA:\n“As regards food, one should take whatever comes.”\nMASTER:\n“What you say applies only to a particular state of the aspirant’s mind. No food can harm a jnani.\nAccording to the\nGita\n, the jnani himself does not eat; his eating is an offering to the Kundalini.\nBut that does not apply to a bhakta. The present state of my mind is such that I cannot eat any food unless it is first offered to God by a brahmin priest. Formerly my state of mind was such that I would enjoy inhaling the smell of burning corpses, carried by the wind from the other side of the Ganges. It tasted very sweet to me. But nowadays I cannot eat food touched by anybody and everybody. No, I cannot. But once in a while I do. One day I was taken to see a performance of a play at Keshab’s house. They gave me luchi and curries to eat. I didn’t know whether the food was handed to me by a washerman or a barber; but I ate quite a little. (\nAll laugh\n.) Rakhal had asked me to eat. (\nTo Narendra\n) “With you it is all right. You are in ‘this’ as well as in ‘that’.\n6\nYou can eat everything now. (\nTo the devotees\n) Blessed is he who feels longing for God, though he eats pork. But shame on him whose mind dwells on ‘woman and gold’, though he eats the purest food — boiled vegetables, rice, and ghee. (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\nSwami Abhedananda Recalled —\nOne day Golap-ma said to the Master: “Dr. Durga Charan of Calcutta is a reputable physician. Perhaps he can find some remedy for you.” Immediately the Master agreed to visit him. That night I stayed at Dakshineswar. Latu and Golap-ma were also there. The next morning the Master, Golap-ma, Latu, and I went to Calcutta by boat. After landing there, we rented a horse carriage and went to the doctor’s office at Beadon Square. Out of his mercy the Master asked me to sit next to him, and Golap-ma and Latu sat on the opposite seat.\nThe doctor examined the Master’s throat and prescribed some medications. Then we went to the Ahiritola ghat and rented a boat for Dakshineswar. It was about 1:30 p.m. and none of us had had any food. The Master was hungry. He asked the boatman to anchor the boat at the Baranagore ghat and then asked me to buy some sweets from a nearby market. Golap-ma had four pice with her which she gave me. I immediately went to the market and bought some chanar murki [small, sweet cheese balls]. The Master took the packet of sweets from my hand and joyfully ate them all. He then threw the empty packet into the Ganges and drank some water from the river with his hands. He showed his satisfaction. The Master knew that the three of us were hungry, but without sharing any sweets he had eaten everything. It was amazing! As soon as his hunger was relieved, our own stomachs felt full. We looked at each other silently. Then the Master smiled and like a boy began to make jokes — which he continued all the way to Dakshineswar. We all got out of the boat, and later the three of us discussed what had happened and realized that it was a miracle.\nA similar event occurred when Krishna was alive and enacted his divine play. When the five Pandavas and their wife Draupadi were living in the forest during their exile, the sage Durvasa went to their cottage with his twelve hundred disciples and asked for food. According to the custom guests had to be fed, for otherwise it would be very inauspicious. Durvasa and his disciples went to the river for a bath, and while they were gone, the helpless Draupadi called on Krishna to come to the rescue. Krishna came and asked Draupadi for some food. There was nothing but a few particles of rice and a little spinach at the bottom of a cooking vessel. Krishna ate this and drank a glass of water and by doing so, filled the stomachs of Durvasa and his disciples. So it is said, “If God is pleased the whole world becomes pleased.” That day I realized this truth by observing Sri Ramakrishna’s life. (Source: God Lived with Them)\nOne day I was extremely hungry, and the Master, as if aware of the fact, quickly took two sweetmeats from the shelf in his room. I thought he knew I was hungry and was going to give them to me, but he did just the opposite. He took them himself. He then asked me to give him a glass of water, which he drank. Then, with evident signs of satiety, he said: “Oh, how relieved I am! I am satisfied.” And strange to say, his satisfaction removed my hunger and thirst. I was reminded of the story in the Mahabharata of how Sri Krishna took a particle of spinach from the cooking pot of Draupadi and appeased the hunger of the sage Durvasa and his party. The same phenomenon revealed itself to me on that day.\n— Vaikuntha Nath Sanyal (Source: Ramakrishna as We Saw Him)",

He who identifies himself with the physical body is Kshara Purusha. He who identifies himself with the mind is called Akshara Purusha. Compared with the body which perishes every time it is born, the mind, which endures birth after birth till the moment of liberation (Moksha), is said to be Akshara or Kutasthah (the immovable). This Akshara Purusha (Manobhimani) Jiva is not the same as the Akshara Parabrahman described in the\n8th Discourse\n. These are poles apart. Brahman is the original Sun and the Jiva is the reflection of the Sun in water. The Jiva mentioned here is different from Brahman of the 8th discourse. In the coming\nverse\n, the Lord describes Purusha who is different from Kshara Purusha and the Akshara Purusha (Jiva) who is the reflected consciousness of Paramatma in the body.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda\nCommentary by Swami Shuddhidananda\nSri Ramakrishna Krishna Says —\n“I was twenty-two or twenty-three when the Divine Mother one day asked me in the Kali temple, ‘Do you want to be\nAkshara\n?’ I didn’t know what the word meant.

The Supreme Purusha is ever free (\nnityamuktah\n), whereas the Jiva attains Mukti by knowledge of the Supreme Purusha.

Therefore He is known as the Supreme Purusha or Purushottama.\nSome people live in the state of the body (have dehasthiti), and some in the state of the Jiva (have Jivasthiti). He who lives in Atma alone is the Supreme Purusha. This is the goal to be attained by all with determined effort. The thoughtful man should not waste his life in the bound conditions of the Jiva. He should find his freedom and perfection. He should go beyond the body-state, the Jiva-state and realise the Atmic state (i.e) the state of the Supreme Purusha. That is the end and aim of life.

The Jiva is no other than the Supreme Purusha.\nCommentary by Swami Shuddhidananda\nSri Ramakrishna Says —\nMASTER (\nsmiling, to M\n.):\n“He went there [referring to Bodh-Gaya].”\nM. (to Narendra):\n“What are the doctrines of Buddha?”\nNARENDRA:\n“He could not express in words what he had realised by his tapasya. So people say he was an atheist.”\nMASTER (\nby signs\n):\n“Why atheist? He was not an atheist. He simply could not express his inner experiences in words.\nDo you know what ‘Buddha’ means? It is to become one with Bodha, Pure Intelligence, by meditating on That which is of the nature of Pure Intelligence; it is to become Pure Intelligence Itself.”\nNARENDRA:\n“Yes, sir. There are three classes of Buddhas: Buddha, Arhat, and Bodhisattva.”\nMASTER:\n“This too is a sport of God Himself, a new lila of God.\n“Why should Buddha be called an atheist? When one realises Svarupa, the true nature of one’s Self, one attains a state that is something between asti, is, and nasti,\nis-not\n.”\nNARENDRA (\nto M\n.):\n“It is a state in which contradictions meet. A combination of hydrogen and oxygen produces cool water; and the same hydrogen and oxygen are used in the oxy-hydrogen blowpipe.\n“In that state both activity and non-activity are possible; that is to say, one then performs unselfish action.\n“Worldly people, who are engrossed in sense-objects, say that everything exists —\nasti\n. But the mayavadis, the illusionists, say that nothing exists —\nnasti\n. The experience of a Buddha is beyond both ‘existence’ and ‘non-existence’.”\nMASTER:\n“This ‘existence’ and ‘non-existence’ are attributes of Prakriti. The Reality is beyond both.”\nThe devotees remained silent a few moments. (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\n—–\n“He who’ is Brahman is the Adyasakti, the Primal Energy. When inactive He is called Brahman, the Purusha; He is called Sakti, or Prakriti, when engaged in creation, preservation, and destruction. These are the two aspects of Reality: Purusha and Prakriti. He who is the Purusha is also Prakriti. Both are the embodiment of Bliss.\n“If you are aware of the Male Principle, you cannot ignore the Female Principle. He who is aware of the father must also think of the mother. (\nKeshab laughs\n.) He who knows darkness also knows light. He who knows night also knows day. He who knows happiness also knows misery. You understand this, don’t you?” (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\n—–\nMASTER (\nto M. and the others\n):\n“Is it an easy thing to obtain the Knowledge of Brahman? It is not possible unless the mind is annihilated. The guru said to the disciple,\n‘Give me your mind and I shall give you Knowledge.’\nIn this state one enjoys only spiritual talk and the company of devotees.\n(\nTo Ram\n) “You are a physician. You know that medicine works only when it mixes with the patient’s blood and becomes one with it. Likewise, in the state of Brahmajnana one sees God both within and without. One sees that it is God Himself who has become the body, mind, life, and soul.”\nM. (\nto himself\n):\n“Assimilation!”\nMASTER:\n“A man attains Brahmajnana as soon as his mind is annihilated. With the annihilation of the mind dies the ego, which says ‘I’, ‘I’. One also attains the Knowledge of Brahman by following the path of devotion. One also attains It by following the path of knowledge, that is to say, discrimination. The jnanis discriminate, saying, ‘Neti, neti’, that is, ‘All this is illusory, like a dream.’ They analyse the world through the process of ‘Not this, not this’; it is maya. When the world vanishes, only the jivas, that is to say, so many egos, remain.\n“Each ego may be likened to a pot. Suppose there are ten pots filled with water, and the sun is reflected in them. How many suns do you see?”\nA DEVOTEE:\n“Ten reflections. Besides, there certainly exists the real sun.”\nMASTER:\n“Suppose you break one pot. How many suns do you see now?”\nDEVOTEE:\n“Nine reflected suns. But there certainly exists the real Sun.”\nMASTER:\n“All right. Suppose you break nine pots. How many suns do you see now?”\nDEVOTEE:\n“One reflected sun. But there certainly exists the real sun.”\nMASTER (\nto Girish\n):\n“What remains when the last pot is broken?”\nGIRISH:\n“That real sun, sir.”\nMASTER:\n“No. What remains cannot be described. What\nis\nremains. How will you know there is a real sun unless there is a reflected sun? ‘I- consciousness’ is destroyed in samadhi. A man climbing down from samadhi to the lower plane cannot describe what he has seen there.” (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\nRâmlâl (nephew of Shri Ramakrishna) came from Dakshineswar. He had long lived with and served the Master and had often sent him into ecstasy by singing devotional songs. He was, therefore, dearly loved by the Order of Ramakrishna. In course of conversation he said:\n“Formerly, the Master and Hriday used to live in the large room of the Kuthi (a building in the Dakshineswar temple) and the Master’s mother used to sleep in an adjoining small room. Many nights they used to hear a man with shoes on going up and down the stairs, and opening doors and windows. It was a ghost-possibly of a European. For the Kuthi had been a European residence before the temple was built.\nThe Master used to say, ‘We cannot say that this world is entirely false. For we are actually seeing it with our eyes. Nor can we say that it is real. For just see how this garden has changed. Formerly it was a graveyard, and this Kuthi, the house of a European. But now! And some days after, this temple also will vanish, and who knows what will come next ?’\n– Swami Premananda (Source: Spiritual Talks by the First Disciples of Sri Ramakrishna)\nRelated Articles:\nI will now describe that which ought to be known, through the knowing of which one attains Immortality. It is the Supreme Brahman, which is without beginning and is said to be neither being nor non-being. (\nBG 13.13\n)\nO I give heat; I hold back and send forth rain. I am immortality, O Arjuna, and also death. I am being and I am non-being. (\nBG 9.19\n)",

    "commentary": "The Lord declares the fruit of understanding the Supreme Purusha as distinguished from the Kshara and Akshara. He says that this Sastra, science taught by Him is the greatest secret (\nguhyatamam\n). The superlative form is used to show that this truth is the highest secret, greatest mystery to be known by man. Generally, no wise man reveals anything to a fool or a braggart. He selects his hearer by knowing his nature and character. Then only he reveals the secret. Here also the Lord has chosen Arjuna to be the recipient of this divine knowledge, because he is sinless (\nanagha\n). It is stated as a rule that Brahmavidya is not taught to persons who are devoid of the essential qualities of self-control. The seeker should first acquire mental purity (\nchittasuddhi\n) and then he gets the qualification (\nadhikara\n) to be initiated into the highest secret.\nIf any one like Arjuna, becomes sinless by devotion, austerity, ‘dhyana’ and other practices, he is certain to obtain the Highest Knowledge from some great-souled teacher (Guru) or by some incidental factor in his life. Or the Lord Himself confers the subtlety of the intellect capable of perceiving the truth (\ndadami buddhi yogam tam\n).\nWhat is the fruit of acquiring this knowledge? He becomes (1) wise (having Self-knowledge), (2) he has accomplished all his duties. The performance of all other works in the world do not lead man to the highest state of perfection and freedom. All other works may confer merit (Punyam) by which one enjoys fruits of good life in other worlds. But still liberation is not attained. He has to be born again and again. When Brahma jnana is attained, he receives the merit of having accomplished all his duties, and has no further work to do with the body in this or in any other world. Therefore it is the duty of all seekers to rise to this plane of liberation and realise the fulness of bliss and blessedness. Without it, the cycle of birth and death continues and sorrow envelops them endlessly.\nCommentary by Swami Shuddhidana\nAdditional Commentary by Swami Shuddhidananda\nSummary of Bhagavad Gita Chapter 15 by Swami Shuddhidananda",
