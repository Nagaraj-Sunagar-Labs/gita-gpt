The Lord is the embodiment of Dharma, Reverence for Dharma is worship of the Lord himself, by the utterence of his name. The aim of the Gita and its main teaching are determined by the very first word. It is Dharma. The lord incarnates himself from time to time to establish Dharma.",

    "commentary": "Dhrishtadyumna, the son of King Drupada was the commander of the Pandava army. He arranged the army in a special formation known as Vajra Vyuha in the science of war. Duryodhana might have approached Dronacharya for the purpose of asking him to arrange his own army in a more powerful formation.\nDuryodhana was a king possessing overall command of the entire army. Drona was one of the commanders. How does it happen that the king, instead of asking the commander to meet him, should himself approach him personally? This doubt may be cleared by considering the following points.\n1. Duryodhana might have been struck with fear when he saw the enemy-army and heroes like Bhima and Arjuna. Fear, of course, is not an auspicious sign.\n2. Drona was a commander and should have been at the post of duty from whence he should not be disturbed at that time.\n3. Drona was a teacher, learned and old, and it was the duty of Duryodhana to show him respect.\n4. The purpose of Duryodhana was to win the favour of Drona for achieving his own selfish object of winning the war against his cousins, who were also the disciples of Drona.\nIt should be noted that Duryodhana, like Arjuna, later saw the armies on both sides. But what a difference in attitude! Duryodhana never had any qualms of conscience, nor any feeling of pity for those who would be destroyed on both sides, nor the supreme question of what is Dharma under these circumstances, nor any reconsideration of his attitude which would naturally arise in the heart of an evolved being. Arjuna was far superior to Duryodhana as a man, and so his reaction was entirely different, and the divine message of the Gita was offered to him.",

    "commentary": "This and the following verses are spoken by Duryodhana. According to common usage, it should be mentioned here as Duryodhana Uvacha.’ But Veda Vyasa does not give him the privilege of naming him as the speaker because he is evil-minded.\nDuryodhana is deeply skilled in diplomacy. He tries to curry the favour of Drona by personally approaching him. Not only that, he tries to rouse Drona’s passions of anger and hatred by referring to Drishtadyumna as the son of King Drupada. Duryodhana knows how Drupada insulted Drona and how Drona avenged the insult by humiliating the king with the help of Arjuna, and how later, Drupada, in a vengeful spirit, obtained through holy sacrifice a son who would cause the death of Drona, and that son was no other than the present commander of the Pandava Army. Duryodhana tries to fan into flame the ancient hatred between Drona and Drupada. His purpose is evidently to rouse the combative spirit of his Master by speaking highly about the enemy-formation under the leadership of his disciple Drishtadyumna is spoken of as ‘\ndhimata\n‘ – well-versed in the art of war. So it is that the Pandavas chose him as the Commander of their army.",

Anandagiri, Sankarananda and others give the meaning ‘limitless’ to the word\naparyaptam\n, Sridhara and others give the opposite meaning ‘limited’. But it appears that the first meaning is more appropriate to the context, and is consistent with the earlier estimate given by Duryodhana. In the Udyoga Parva (54, 60, 70) and in the Bhishma Parva (51-4-6) Duryodhana, speaking to his father and Drona respectively glorifies the strength of his own army. There is every reason why he should speak well of his own army in the present situation, when they are about to fight the battle. It should also be remembered that in the Bhishma Parva speaking to Drona, Duryodhana utters exactly the same verse while estimating the superior power of his own army\nWell-protected by Bhima – Why should Duryodhana refer to the Pandava army as well-protected by Bhima, when Dhristadyumna is the actual commander? The following reasons may be considered.\n1. Duryodhana naturally thinks of Bhima as the most deadly enemy to himself and to his brothers 2. Though Dhristadyumna is the commander, Bhima was entrusted with the task of protecting the army. 3. On the first day, Bhima was posted at the foremost point of the Vajra Vyuha. So it is quite probable that Duryodhana should see Bhima first at the head of the Pandava Army.",

The son of Drupada, Sikhandi, was first a eunuch. Bhishma has pledged that he would never face a eunuch in battle. So, if the Pandavas should place Sikhandi at the foremost point of their army, Bhishma would not face it, and so his power would be partially neutralised. Taking advantage of it, the enemies might injure and kill him. Duryodhana knew the secret. So he directs all the leaders of his army to see that Sikhandi is kept out of the way, so that Bhishma would be free to fight at his best. If Bhishma was safe, he would be able to make the most powerful onslaught on the enemy, and be the bulwark of defense for the entire Kaurava army. Knowing this he directed all to protect Bhishma in all possible ways.",

So Arjuna refers to him as a wicked man. ‘\nBuddhi nasat pranasyati\n‘. The Lord declares that man perishes when he loses the power of discrimination. Therefore the epithet ‘durbuddhi’ is indicative of the impending destruction of Duryodhana. It is a warning to all those whose mental disposition is darkened by evil propensities, that, like Duryodhana, they would ruin themselves by defeat, disgrace and death. Let everybody therefore strive for purity of mind and heart for spiritual progress.\nWishing to please:\nAll those who sided Duryodhana perished. To support and encourage evil is also evil, and such a man suffers the same fate as the evil-doer. It should by all means be avoided by the spiritual seeker.",

    "translation": "O Krishna! I do not desire victory or kingdom or pleasures. Of what avail are these kingdom, enjoyment, or even life itself to us.",
    "commentary": "The Sastras say that the knowledge of Atma should be taught only to those who possess this quality of renunciation. Does Arjuna possess this quality? Is he fit to receive the supreme knowledge? This doubt is cleared by this verse. For some reason or other, he now feels the futility of all earthly pleasures and enjoyments. feels the futility of all earthly glory and the wretchedness of all earthly Life itself appears as a useless waste. He has no relish for it. He feels that even if he is offered dominion over the three worlds, it is of no avail to him.\nThis is the auspicious moment for the revelation of the supreme wisdom. Therefore, Lord Krishna chooses this particular moment, when the fire of renunciation burns brightest in the heart of Arjuna to teach the highest spiritual knowledge.",

    "translation": "Sanjaya said: Arjuna, having spoken thus on the battlefield, cast aside his bow and arrow and sank down on his chariot-seat, his mind overcome with grief.",
    "commentary": "With the mind distressed by sorrow:\nArjuna dropped the great bow Gandiva and sat down in a mood of doubt, despair and helplessness. Never before in his life did he do so on any battle-field in any situation. So there should be a powerful cause for the present problem of Arjuna. This cause is easily discernable from his own words. It is nothing but the deeply planted feeling of attachment for his relations and friends, and the awful contemplation of slaying them in the battle. He speaks repeatedly of ‘\nsvajanam\n‘ (our people). His distress for the destruction of his own people touches his very heart and throws the whole man off his balance. As a result, he decides to give up every thing-kingdom, pleasures, and enjoyments, even dominion over the three worlds. Lord Krishna seizes this opportune moment when Arjuna’s mind was filled with the thought of absolute renunciation and teaches the highest Brahmavidya. Hence Arjuna’s despondency is transformed into a Yoga.\nArjuna yearned to know what was Dharma, having given up all dominion, pleasures and enjoyment. Hence it is Yoga. Such deep renunciation is essential for all seekers after truth. It ultimately leads to righteousness and union with God. Dispassion for earthly enjoyments and burning passion for truth are the ‘\nsine quanon\n‘ of spiritual life. It is this passion for truth that drives the aspirant forward on the path of spiritual realisation. Arjuna experienced the two feelings in the present situation. So he is fully qualified to realise the teaching of the Lord. If any man, for any reason, is prompted by feelings of dispassion for earthly objects, and a yearning for truth, he receives the Grace of God by which he comes to know the Truth and attains peace and blessedness.",
