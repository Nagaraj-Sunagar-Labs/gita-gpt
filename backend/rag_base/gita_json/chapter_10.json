    "translation": "The Lord said: Once more, Ο mighty Arjuna, listen to My supreme word, which I, from a desire for your welfare, will impart to you, to your great delight.",
    "commentary": "The Lord was pleased to find that Arjuna, like a true disciple, was diligently listening to His words, most delighted with the teaching of the Divine Master. So the Lord proceeds to declare more and more of his divine power even before he asks for it. Such would be the love of the Master of a true disciple. As the Master finds the disciple in a receptive mood, full of faith and diligence, he reveals more of the Royal Secret out of the fulness of His heart. That is why the Lord says “delighting in my words” (“Priyamanaya’), referring to Arjuna’s absorption in His teaching. Arjuna’s doubt and grief were disappearing fast as the Lord continued to speak. The Lord knew it. So he speaks with a mightier accent and reveals more of His Divine Yoga. Again (Bhuyah) the Lord repeats and emphasises His universality and the hearer understands it, thinks of it and meditates on it. Repeated hearing of the Truth, constant thinking of it, and continuous meditation on it – this is the only way to absorb the Truth and make it one’s own.\nVivekananda says\n: “This Atman is first to be heard of. Hear day and night that you are that Soul. Repeat it to yourself day and night till it enters into your very veins, till it tingles in every drop of blood, till it is in your flesh and bone.” Such should be the immovable firmness of conviction in the Divine Truth. So the Lord repeats, expounds, declares, and proclaims His Divine Glory.\nThe Lord wishes to do good to His disciple. What is the greatest good that man can obtain? Not certainly wealth and enjoyments, but Knowledge of Paramatma, by which man realises his blissful and blessed Self.\nParamam vachah:\nThe Lord’s teaching is wonderful for it removes the veil of ignorance, dispels all darkness from the human heart. Let mankind hear the Lord’s Supreme word.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda",

    "translation": "Who knows Me as the birthless, without a beginning, the Lord of all the worlds, he among mortals is undeluded and freed from all sins.",
    "commentary": "Among living beings of the world, man is the highest incarnation and among mortals, he who knows the Lord as unborn and beginningless is the greatest. Paramatma is unborn (\najah\n) and He has no beginning (\nanadi\n). All other beings have a beginning and end. They are born in time and die in time. Knowledge of Paramatma alone confers immortality on man. He becomes free from delusion. This indeed is the highest reward which man can get by his devotion to the Lord. All other worldly benefits are impermanent and illusory. They lead to sorrow and death. So it is the primary duty of all seekers to hold on to the Lord and transcend delusion with His grace. When delusion is gone, man is at once freed from all sin. When man becomes sinless he becomes one with Paramatma. Though a man is burdened with all the sins in the world, yet, like fire burning up a vast forest, God’s grace destroys the entire sin. So, devotion to the Lord is what is most essential. And his devotion is cultivated, strengthened, and developed by understanding the infinite Glory of the Lord. As man thinks constantly of the inscrutable power of the Lord, his adoration increases, and his worship becomes truer, deeper, and broader.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda\nSri Ramakrishna Says —\nA DEVOTEE:\n“Sir, is there no help, then, for such a worldly person?”\nMASTER:\n“Certainly there is. From time to time he should live in the company of holy men, and from time to time go into solitude to meditate on God. Furthermore, he should practise discrimination and pray to God, ‘Give me faith and devotion.’\nOnce a person has faith he has achieved everything. There is nothing greater than faith.\n(To Kedar) “You must have heard about the tremendous power of faith. It is said in the Purana that Rama, who was God Himself — the embodiment of Absolute Brahman — had to build a bridge to cross the sea to Ceylon. But Hanuman, trusting in Rama’s name, cleared the sea in one jump and reached the other side. He had no need of a bridge. (All laugh.) “Once a man was about to cross the sea. Bibhishana wrote Rama’s name on a leaf, tied it in a corner of the man’s wearing-cloth, and said to him: ‘Don’t be afraid. Have faith and walk on the water. But look here — the moment you lose faith you will be drowned.’ The man was walking easily on the water. Suddenly he had an intense desire to see what was tied in his cloth. He opened it and found only a leaf with the name of Rama written on it. ‘What is this?’ he thought. ‘Just the name of Rama!’ As soon as doubt entered his mind he sank under the water.\n“If a man has faith in God, then even if he has committed the most heinous sins — such as killing a cow, a brahmin, or a woman — he will certainly be saved through his faith. Let him only say to God, ‘O Lord,! will not repeat such an action’, and he need not be afraid of anything.”\n(\nBG 10.3\n,\nBG 4.36\n,\nBG 9.32\n,\nBG 18.66\n)\nWhen he had said this, the Master sang:\nIf only I can pass away repeating Durga’s name,\nHow canst Thou then, O Blessed One,\nWithhold from me deliverance,\nWretched though I may be?\nI may have stolen a drink of wine, or killed a child unborn,\nOr slain a woman or a cow,\nOr even caused a brahmin’s death;\nBut, though it all be true,\nNothing of this can make me feel the least uneasiness;\nFor through the power of Thy sweet name\nMy wretched soul may still aspire\nEven to Brahmanhood. (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\nRelated Articles:\nThose who understand the divine nature of My birth and activities, O Arjun, upon leaving the body, do not have to take birth again, but come to My eternal abode. (\nBG 4.9\n)\nAmong thousands of men, one strives for perfection and even among those who strive and succeed, one knows Me in essence. (\nBG 7.3\n)\nAt the end of many births the man of wisdom seeks refuge in Me, realizing that Vāsudeva is all. Rare indeed is such a high-souled person. (\nBG 7.19\n)",

    "commentary": "Sixteen good qualities and four bad qualities are mentioned in these two verses. All these qualities proceed from the Lord Himself. What does this mean? It does not mean that God gives good qualities to some people and bad qualities to others. He has already declared “There is no one hateful or dear to Me.” This being so, the qualities exhibited by different people are the result of their own thoughts and actions.

It is by the Lord’s power that these qualities, good and bad come to man, though the Lord is just a witness only and is not affected by them. The Lord does not cause karma.

    "commentary": "The Lord declares that the Seven great Rishis, the four ancient Devarshis, the fourteen Manus, were all born of the divine samkalpa, partaking of His nature. These indeed are the original ancestors and the creators of this world. They are all devotees of the Lord, possessing perfect Atmajnana.\nThe inscrutable power of the Lord is proclaimed here, for, by a wish of His mind, came forth these beings of the highest order. And from them originated all the beings of the world.\nThe mysterious power of the Lord should inspire the deepest reverence in the heart of every man. Man’s duty is to bow down before God and remember Him forever and ever.\nThe great sages, the Devarshis and the Manus are of the nature of the Lord. They are the highest devotees and perfected beings, (i.e) they are jnanis of the highest order, who possess direct knowledge of Brahman. They know the highest Truth. All the beings of the world, are the progeny of these great souls. They partake of the nature of God, and all others partake of the nature of these Divine manifestations. Should not people then be full of devotion and wisdom? Is it not a denial of one’s heritage and birthright to entangle himself in the bonds of the objective world and get lost in the wilderness of Samsara? People remember their sage-ancestors when they perform their morning and evening ablutions (\nSandhyavandanam\n). It is a reminder to all that like their ancestors they should rise to the plane of the spirit. Ancestral property, wealth, power, and possessions, do not save men from destruction if they forget the Divinity in them and sink in the mire of ignorance and delusion. It is the ancient wisdom alone that could save man from sorrow and death.\nLet people be filled with this great idea that they have for their ancestors the great sages, Devarshis and Manus. Let them share the devotion and wisdom of their Divine forefathers. No one should think that he is low-born and weak. The blood of the Divine fore-fathers is flowing in everybody’s veins, irrespective of his caste and faith. So let one demand his birthright of devotion and knowledge. It is not the personal possession of anyone. All beings have right over that Divine knowledge. The outcastes as well as people of the highest rank and position possess the same right to wisdom and perfection. The Lord has proclaimed the Divine birth-right of all men. So if one should be asked to declare his ancestry, let him say boldly that he is the child of the great Rishis and Manus. If anybody thinks he is low-born, he degenerates into a vile man. If he thinks that he is pure and perfect, he does become the real child of the ancient Masters. Therefore, may all beings remember their holy fore-fathers every day, and by acquiring their great qualities, break the shackles of bondage and enjoy perfect peace and joy.\nAmong the above-mentioned, the Devarshis (Sanaka Sanandana, Sanatkumara, Sanatsujata) taught the path of the withdrawal from worldly life (\nNivrithimarga\n). The fourteen Manus taught the path of Dharma, righteous conduct of life (\nPravrittimarga\n). The first belongs to the line of the Gurus, and the second to the line of the ancestors. All these are brought forth from the Supreme Being, by a wish (samkalpa) of His mind. So ultimately all are the children of the Lord and He is the father of all. Since Sanaka and others are born-celibates, to say that people are born of them implies that they are their disciples (Sishyas), the children of their wisdom.",

    "commentary": "There are many who repeat God’s name, serve Him, and meditate on Him. But very few are capable of pure devotion born of true realisation that He is the source of all things. Pure devotion is therefore the result of real understanding of the creative power of the Lord and His wonderful manifestation.\nWithout understanding how the Lord is present in the universe, it is difficult to cultivate true faith, and without faith pure devotion is not possible.\nWhen man knows that the Lord is the final cause of everything, and that there is nothing else but He in all things, he spontaneously offers worship to Him. Such an act of devotion and surrender will be deep-felt, sincere and true. The devotee’s surrender is deep, firm, unalterable and unconditional, for the very reason that he knows the real presence of the Lord in everything and all that takes place in the universe.\nThis thought (\n‘bhava’\n) of the devotee is like the shell in the cannon. Mere powder without the shell can only produce smoke and fire, but the target cannot be shattered. Similarly, unless the devotee combines the thought (‘bhava’) with the japa or meditation or worship, he cannot reach the goal. This point should be carefully noted. Though many people practice Japa and Dhyana, some are not able to make any progress towards the goal, because they are lacking in\n‘bhava’\n. To experience ‘bhava’, pure devotion is essential; for pure devotion there should be true understanding of the Lord and His wonderful manifestation. All these ideas are revealed in this verse.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda",

    "translation": "With their thought fixed on Me, with their life absorbed in Me, enlightening one another about Me, and always conversing about Me, they derive satisfaction and delight.",
    "commentary": "The life of the true devotee is beautifully described in this verse. The life and mental functions of the ignorant are wholly devoted to the world, and they live and die entangled in the meshes of samsara. But the real devotee consecrates his body, mind and life to the Lord. His mind thinks of the Lord; his limbs do the work of the Lord; his eyes see the Lord; his reason understands the presence of the Lord everywhere. His whole life is thus absorbed in the Lord. His whole life is a continued worship. When the devotees meet together they only talk of God, His power, and Yoga. God’s glory is infinite. Everywhere, in everything, God’s power is manifesting itself. So the devotee goes on thinking and speaking of God’s Glory. Such holy company is the highest spiritual education that man can get. All doubts are cleared by mutual enlightenment. There is a powerful current, spiritual thought, and emotion, circulating among them. The very air they breathe is full of knowledge and bliss.\nDo we not see how worldly people talk of worldly matters endlessly? That is their samskara. If anyone mentions the name of God in such a company he is ridiculed and condemned. The true aspirant should not mix in such a company.\nThe devotee is like a ripe fruit full of sweet juice. Sweet juice comes out of it always. The devotee is again like a full-blown flower. Sweet fragrance envelopes the whole flower. So also, the whole life and thought of the devotee is blessed with divine contemplation and action.\nA group of devotees thinking of God and His ways and exchanging intimate thoughts and experiences is verily a Heaven on earth. They receive knowledge from one another, derive inspiration and encouragement, test and confirm their views, attitudes and angles of vision. Such mutual enlightenment increases one’s faith in God, and draws him nearer the Truth,\nThe devotees feel satisfied and delighted. The contemplation of the Divine is an end in itself, and joy derived from it is pure and perfect. When a person begins to feel this joy which is unlike any other sensual pleasure, he finds no attraction for anything else. He sings the name of the Lord in ecstatic joy, he laughs, he speaks out of the fullness of joy, and gets himself lost in divine intoxication. For him, the whole world is transfigured and defined. He sees the Lord everywhere and he sees nothing other than the Lord anywhere.\nThe devotee’s life is dedicated and consecrated to the Lord. His one and only aim is to know the Lord and be with Him. He is ready to sacrifice his life for realising his aim. Such a resolute spirit is necessary for God-realisation. Life is nothing if God is not realised. We find great idealists giving up everything for attaining their ideal. So also the believers in God are ready to give up their life in their effort to reach Him. Lukewarm-faith does not lead to the goal quickly. The sacrifice should be complete and unconditional. Then the Lord is pleased, and immortality is attained. That is why it is said\n“tyagennike amritatvamanasuh.”\n– by sacrifice alone, immoratality is obtained. Great souls surrender their all to the Lord.\nThis verse gives a vivid picture of the daily life and work of the devotee dedicated to the realisation of the Supreme.\nBhagavad Gita 10.9 to 10.11 by Swami Chetanananda\nSri Ramakrishna Says —\nSri Ramakrishna was encouraging Nanda.\nMASTER (\nto Nanda\n):\n“Though you are a householder, still you have kept your mind on God. Is that a small thing? The man who has renounced the world will pray to Him as a matter of course. Is there any credit in that? But blessed indeed is he who, while leading a householder’s life, prays to God. He is like a man who finds an object after removing a stone weighing twenty maunds.\n“One should pray to God, establishing with Him an appropriate relationship. Hanuman’s love for God was mixed with knowledge; but Narada’s love for God was pure and unadulterated.\n“Rama asked Hanuman, ‘Hanuman, what attitude do you cherish toward Me when you worship Me?’ Hanuman answered: ‘Sometimes I see that You are the whole and I am a part; sometimes I see that You are the Master and I am Your servant. But Rama, when I have the Knowledge of Reality, then I find that You are I and I am You.’\n“Rama said to Narada, ‘Ask a favour of Me.’ Narada said, ‘O Rama, grant me the boon that I may have genuine love for Thy Lotus Feet and that I may not come under the spell of Thy world-bewitching maya!'” (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)",

    "translation": "On those who are ever devoted to Me and worship Me with love, I bestow the yoga of understanding, by which they come to Me.",
    "commentary": "This is one of the key verses in the Gita, in which the link between bhakti and jnana, devotion and knowledge, is clearly stated. Bhakti, Jnana that is the natural order of evolution in Self-realisation. The Lord declares that to those who are ever devoted to Him in love, He gives ‘\nbuddhi yoga\n‘-the yoga of discrimination and wisdom by which they come unto Him.\nBrahmajnana is the gift of the Lord. The realisation of the Jiva that Brahman alone is and that he is no other than Brahman, is Brahmajnana. This knowledge is in the hands of God, and it can be obtained by means of loving and faithful worship. When the Lord is pleased with His devotee, He bestows Brahmajnana which unites the devotee and the Lord forever and ever. So Bhakti is the first step in spiritual evolution for all seekers. When we come across rare men who are born with Brahmajnana, it should be understood that they have spent many many lives in pure and loving devotion to the Lord.\nHere two great qualities of the devotee are mentioned (1) steadfastness in devotion (2) worshipping with love.\n(1) Continuous memory of the Lord is essential. How can the devotee have continuous memory of the Lord? This Discourse shows the way. The manifold manifestations of the Lord are vividly presented to fill the imagination of the devotee. Wherever he turns, the Lord is there in one form or other. If one recalls to his mind the\nverses 7 to 11 in the Seventh Discourse\n, and verses\n16 to 19 in the Ninth Discourse\n, and the whole of the Vibhuti yoga, he understands the universal manifestation of the Lord everywhere. So the devotee should recognise the Lord’s presence everywhere and thus the devotion becomes continuous in course of time.\n(2) Loving worship of the Lord is another attribute of devotees. Is not the Lord the friend of all beings? Though he is the sovereign of all the worlds. He is at the same time a friend of all. He declares Himself to be a friend again and again. Does He not say to Arjuna ‘you are dear to Me’? What then should be man’s love and affection for the Lord? Such love is needed, and since God’s love is infinite, no one should feel that His grace has not descended on him. Knowing full well from experience and observation that the foolish little things to which one is desperately clinging are vanishing into nothing, let the seeker have love for the Lord who is the only saviour from all the sorrows and miseries of life.",

    "translation": "Solely out of compassion for them, I, dwelling in their hearts, dispel with the shining lamp of wisdom the darkness born of ignorance.",
    "commentary": "The Lord’s compassion for His devotees is revealed here. The Lord is pleased with their undivided devotion, and wishes to confer an eternal gift on them. The Lord knows wealth, power, position and children, are not eternal reward. They pass away in time. So He wishes to bestow on them the everlasting gift of Brahmajnana. We understand from this that no one can reach that state without God’s grace, and that God’s grace is to be attained by pure and perfect devotion to the Lord.\nKnowledge derived through\nBuddhiyoga\nis compared to a lamp that dispels darkness as soon as it is lighted. The light of knowledge thus shatters all darkness of ignorance. Nothing else but light can dispel darkness. One may struggle with darkness eternally with all his weapons, and yet it will not go, till by striking a match he brings in light. Such also is ignorance. One may do everything – Japa, Tapa, Pranayama, or Karma – and yet ignorance cannot be removed except by the flash of intuitional knowledge of Self. All other practices are intended to purify the mind and render it capable of perceiving the Truth (Brahman). They are means of Self-purification.\nWho causes this flash of knowledge? Who confers this Buddhiyoga? The Lord. Where is He seated? He is seated in the human heart. It is He who kindles the light of knowledge. Without His grace, this cannot happen. And this lamp of knowledge (\njnanadipa\n) is luminous (\nbhasvata\n). It is self-luminous, it is luminosity itself. Its effect is immediate. The darkness of ignorance which is enveloping man for ages and ages is shattered at one stroke, once and for all. No more does he wander in the wilderness of samsara. No more does he think of quenching his thirst in the waters of a mirage. He now knows the sharp distinction between the real and the unreal. He is now a\nJivanmuktah\n. The bound soul who was thinking of himself as a body, subject to birth and death and all the thousand shocks of earthly existence, now realises in a flash that He is the immaculate and perfect Atma. He will realise that all those former thoughts of himself as a mortal, man and woman, weak and strong, happy and unhappy, lucky and unlucky, were mere superstitious hallucinations, and delusions. He will realise that at no time was he bound, that he is free at all times, but imagined himself to be bound and enslaved by ignorance (Avidya). He regains his freedom which is his birth-right, which he thought he had lost but which he never really lost. This knowledge comes to the devotee by the grace of the Lord.\n“I destroy the darkness born of ignorance is the exhortation of the Lord.” The Lord has declared that Maya is difficult to cross, but those who take refuge in Him cross over His Maya which is Divine and composed of qualities. As this is the Lord’s promise, the aspirants have the duty to put faith in Him and worship Him with all their heart and soul. Then they will receive Brahmajnana, as the highest reward of their devotion. It comes at the proper time when the aspirant is ripe enough to receive it. So, no one need be disheartened that he has not yet received the light. Let him carry out the command of the Lord and wait with absolute trust and faith in the Divine will.",

    "commentary": "When the Lord spoke of His compassion for the devotees, and how he confers knowledge on them who worship Him with love and faith, Arjuna was lifted up by a mighty upsurge of devotional fervour. His adoration for the Lord reaches the peak point. His love and worship attain the highest state. His joy knows no bounds. From that fulness of heart proceeds Arjuna’s ecstatic adoration as revealed in these two verses. Such devotion to the Guru is needed to receive enlightenment. The blossoming of the heart through devotion makes the disciple fit to understand the Truth propounded by the Master.\nBhagavad Gita 10.12 to 10.18 by Swami Chetanananda\nSri Ramakrishna Says —\n“\nIt is God alone who incarnated Himself as man to teach people the ways of love and knowledge.\nWell, what do you think of me?\n“Once my father went to Gaya. There Raghuvir said to him in a dream, ‘I shall be born as your son.’ Thereupon my father said to Him: ‘O Lord, I am a poor brahmin. How shall I be able to serve You?’ ‘Don’t worry about it’, Raghuvir replied. ‘It will be taken care of.’\n“My sister, Hriday’s mother, used to worship my feet with flowers and sandal-paste. One day I placed my foot on her head and said to her, ‘You will die in Benares.’\n“Once Mathur Babu said to me: ‘Father, there is nothing inside you but God. Your body is like an empty shell. It may look from outside like a pumpkin, but inside there is nothing — neither flesh nor seed. Once I saw you as someone moving with a veil on.’\n(\nTo M\n.) “I am shown everything beforehand. Once I saw Gauranga and his devotees singing kirtan in the Panchavati. I think I saw Balaram there and you too.\n“I wanted to know the experiences of Gauranga and was shown them at Syambazar in our native district. A crowd gathered; they even climbed the trees and the walls; they stayed with me day and night. For seven days I had no privacy whatever. Thereupon I said to the Divine Mother, ‘Mother, I have had enough of it.’\n“I am at peace now. I shall have to be born once more. Therefore I am not giving all knowledge to my companions. (\nWith a smile\n) Suppose I give you all knowledge; will you then come to me again so willingly?\n“I recognized you on hearing you read the\nChaitanya Bhagavat\n. (A life of Chaitanya.) You are my own. The same substance, like father and son. All of you are coming here again. When you pull one part of the kalmi creeper, all the branches come toward you. You are all relatives — like brothers. Suppose Rakhal, Harish, and the others had gone to Puri, and you were there too. Would you live separately?\n“Before you came here, you didn’t know who you were. Now you will know.\nIt is God who, as the guru, makes one know.\n(Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\n—–\n(\nTo M\n.) “When God assumes a human body for the sake of His devotees, many of His devotees accompany Him to this earth. Some of them belong to the inner circle, some to the outer circle, and some become the suppliers of His physical needs.\n“I experienced one of my first ecstasies when I was ten or eleven years old, as I was going through a meadow to the shrine of Visalakshi. What a vision! I became completely unconscious of the outer world.\n“I was twenty-two or twenty-three when the Divine Mother one day asked me in the Kali temple, ‘Do you want to be\nAkshara\n?’ I didn’t know what the word meant. I asked Haladhari about it. He said, ‘\nKshara\nmeans jiva, living being;\nAkshara\nmeans\nParamatman\n, the Supreme Soul.’\n“At the hour of the evening worship in the Kali temple I would climb to the roof of the kuthi and cry out: ‘O devotees, where are you all? Come to me soon! I shall die of the company of worldly people!’ I told all this to the ‘Englishmen’. They said it was all an illusion of my mind. ‘Perhaps it is’, I said to myself, and became calm. But now it is all coming true; the devotees are coming.\n“The Divine Mother also showed me in a vision the five suppliers of my needs; first, Mathur Babu, and second, Sambhu Mallick, whom I had not then met. I had a vision of a fair-skinned man with a cap on his head. Many days later, when I first met Sambhu, I recalled that vision; I realised that it was he whom I had seen in that ecstatic state. I haven’t yet found out the three other suppliers of my wants. But they were all of a fair complexion. Surendra looks like one of them.\n“When I attained this state of God-Consciousness, a person exactly resembling myself thoroughly shook my Ida, Pingala, and Sushumna nerves. He licked with his tongue each of the lotuses of the six centres, and those drooping lotuses at once turned their faces upward. And at last the Sahasrara lotus became full-blown.\n“The Divine Mother used to reveal to me the nature of the devotees before their coming. I saw with these two eyes — not in a trance — the kirtan party of Chaitanya going from the banyan-tree to the bakul-tree in the Panchavati. I saw Balaram in the procession and also, I think, yourself [meaning M.]. Chuni’s spiritual consciousness and yours, too, have been awakened by frequent visits to me. In a vision I saw that Sashi and Sarat had been among the followers of Christ.\n“Under the banyan-tree in the Panchavati I had a vision of a child. Hriday said to me, ‘Then a son will soon be born to you.’ I said to him: ‘But I regard all women as mother. How can I have a son?’ That child is Rakhal.\n“I said to the Divine Mother, ‘O Mother, since You have placed me in this condition, provide me with a rich man.’ That is why Mathur served me for fourteen years.(From 1858 to 1871.) And in how many different ways! At my request he arranged a special store-room for the sadhus. He provided me with carriage and palanquin. And whatever I asked him to give to anyone, he gave. The Brahmani\n2\nidentified him with Prataprudra.\n3\n“Vijay had a vision of this form [meaning himself]. How do you account for it? Vijay said to me, ‘I touched it exactly as I am touching you now.’\n“Latu counted thirty-one devotees in all. That’s not many. But a few more are becoming devotees through Vijay and Kedar.\n“It was revealed to me in a vision that during my last days I should have to live on pudding. During my present illness my wife was one day feeding me with pudding. I burst into tears and said, ‘Is this my living on pudding near the end, and so painfully?'” (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\nIn 1910 Surendranath Sarkar went to Kothar, in Orissa, to receive initiation from Holy Mother. After the ceremony, he said to her: “Mother, the devotees call you Kali, Adyashakti, and Bhagavati. It is mentioned in the Gita that the sages Asita, Devala, Vyasa, and others considered Krishna to be Narayana Himself. Krishna himself confirmed this to Arjuna. The word ‘himself’ strengthened the statement. I believe whatever I have heard about you. Yet, if you substantiate those statements about yourself, then I will be free from doubt. I want to hear from you directly whether this is true or not.”\nHoly Mother replied: “Yes, it is true.” (Source: Sri Sarada Devi and Her Divine Play)\n—–\nOnce, not long after Ramakrishna’s death, Holy Mother was travelling to Jayrambati from Kamarpukur. Shivaram, the Master’s nephew, was then a young boy. He was travelling with the Mother and carrying her bundle. As they neared Jayrambati, Shivaram thought of something and stopped. The Mother was surprised and asked him to keep up.\nShivaram replied, “I shall move only if you tell me something.”\n“What?”\n“Will you tell me who you are?”\n“Who else am I? I am your aunt.”\n“Then you can go by yourself. You are near your home. I won’t go with you.”\n“Don’t be silly. Who do you think I am? I am a human being, your aunt.”\n“Very good. Then why don’t you go on by yourself?” The sun was about to set. Seeing Shivaram standing still in the meadow, Holy Mother said: “People say I am Kali.”\n“Are you really Kali? Is it true?”\n“Yes,” Holy Mother replied. Shivaram was pleased and said: “Let us go then.” (Source: Sri Sarada Devi and Her Divine Play)",

    "commentary": "Indeed, where can there be an end to the glorious manifestation of the Lord? He is infinite, and so His Glory is infinite. That is why the Lord declares only the most excellent in which the seeker could easily discover the Lord’s presence. In fact, there is not a particle of matter or energy or intelligence or virtue which is not a manifestation of the Lord. This universality of outlook and inner understanding is the highest form of devotion.\nBhagavad Gita 10.19 to 10.20 by Swami Chetanananda\nSri Ramakrishna Says —\nMASTER (\nto the devotees\n):\n“To lean against a bolster!” (Rich and aristocratic persons seeking comfort generally sit in this fashion.) You see, it is very difficult to give up vanity. You may discriminate, saying that the ego is nothing at all; but still it comes, nobody knows from where. A goat’s legs jerk for a few moments even after its head has been cut off. Or perhaps you are frightened in a dream; you shake off sleep and are wide awake, but still you feel your heart palpitating. Egotism is exactly like that. You may drive it away, but still it appears from somewhere. Then you look sullen and say: ‘What! I have not been shown proper respect!'”\nKEDAR:\n“‘One should be lowlier than a straw and patient as a tree.'”\nMASTER:\n“As for me, I consider myself as a speck of the dust of the devotee’s feet.”\nVaidyanath arrived. He was a well-educated man, a lawyer of the High Court of Calcutta. With folded hands he saluted the Master and took his seat at one side.\nSURENDRA (\nto the Master\n):\n“He is one of my relatives.”\nMASTER:\n“Yes, I see he has a nice nature.”\nSURENDRA:\n“He has come here because he wants to ask you a question or two.”\nMASTER (\nto Vaidyanath\n):\n“All that you see is the manifestation of God’s Power. No one can do anything without this Power. But you must remember that there is not an equal manifestation of God’s Power in all things. Vidyasagar once asked me whether God endowed some with greater power than others. I said to him; ‘If there are no greater and lesser manifestations of His Power, then why have we taken the trouble to visit you? Have you grown two horns?’ So it stands to reason that God exists in all beings as the All-pervasive Power; but the manifestations of His Power are different in different beings.”\n(Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\n—–\n“Why do I feel so restless for Rakhal, Narendra, and the other youngsters? Hazra once asked me, ‘When will you think of God if you are always anxious about these boys?’ (\nKeshab and the others smile\n.) That worried me greatly. I prayed to the Divine Mother: ‘Mother, see what a fix I am in! Hazra scolds me because I worry about these young men.’ Afterwards I asked Bholanath about it. He said to me that such a state of mind is described in the\nMahabharata\n. How else will a man established in samadhi occupy his mind in the phenomenal world, after coming down from samadhi? That is why he seeks the company of devotees endowed with sattva. I gave a sigh of relief when Bholanath told me of the\nMahabharata\n.\n“Hazra is not to blame. During the period of struggle one should follow the method of discrimination — ‘Not this, not this’ — and direct the whole mind to God. But the state of perfection is quite different. After reaching God one reaffirms what formerly one denied. To extract butter you must separate it from the buttermilk. Then you discover that butter and buttermilk are intrinsically related to one another. They belong to the same stuff. The butter is not essentially different from the buttermilk, nor the buttermilk essentially different from the butter. After realizing God one knows definitely that it is He who has become everything. In some objects He is manifested more clearly, and in others less clearly. (\nBG 10.17\n,\nBG 10.19\n)\n“When a flood comes from the ocean, all the land is deep under water. Before the flood, the boat could have reached the ocean only by following the winding course of the river. But after the flood, one can row straight to the ocean. One need not take a roundabout course. After the harvest has been reaped, one need not take the roundabout course along the balk of the field. One can cross the field at any point.\n“After the realisation of God, He is seen in all beings. But His greater manifestation is in man. Again, among men, God manifests Himself more clearly in those devotees who are sattvic, in those who have no desire whatever to enjoy ‘woman and gold’. Where can a man of samadhi rest his mind, after coming down from the plane of samadhi? That is why he feels the need of seeking the company of pure-hearted devotees, endowed with sattva and free from attachment to ‘woman and gold’. How else could such a person occupy himself in the relative plane of consciousness?

As Atma, he is the eternal witness (\nSakshi\n) of the functions of the body, mind, and buddhi (reason). Atma, the witness is no other than Jivatma (Pratyagatma) who is no other than Paramatma. The Mahavakya that embodies the highest Truth is here stated. The Jiva, by ignorance, has identified himself with the extraneous body and mind, and thus he has forgotten his divine nature. When knowledge dawns, this very Jiva comes to realise in a flash that he is Paramatma Himself, and there the quest for Truth comes to an end, for he has now discovered that he is the all-pervading all-blissful, omniscient Self of all. All ideas of littleness and separateness are mere superstitions and hallucinations. They should be rejected once and for all, and the Divinity of the Self should be clearly understood, firmly held, and definitely realised.\nThe Lord is present in every being. So, love and friendly feelings towards all, non-injury and service, should be cultivated by the seeker in the true spirit that he is serving the Lord Himself.\nAs the world is super-imposed on the Lord who is the basis and foundation, and as what is super-imposed (like the snake in the rope) cannot be different from the orginal, the Lord is Himself the universe. Therefore He is its origin, its middle and its end.\nLet all the aspirants think of the grand and lofty truth that they are veritably the Pratyagatma, and certainly not the little ego caught in the cage of flesh. So thinking and meditating, the Truth is permanently realised in proper season. Then is man released from all dreams of pain, sorrow and delusion. Thus\nArise, awake, and stop not till the goal is reached\n.",

And yet all the power of Hiranyakasipu was of no avail when he had to deal with his own little child Prahlada, who was born with Brahmajnana by the grace of Narada. The Daitya King tried all weapons at his command to kill Prahlada, but nothing could destroy the child who was one with the Lord Himself. So the Lord here declares that He is Prahlada among the Daityas. In the supreme state of Bhakti, the devotee and the Lord are one. Though the child was born in the demonical race, yet he could attain Divinity and perfection. So, race and birth are of no importance in spiritual enlightenment. Everyone can seek for it and find it by the very purity of his heart and the intensity of his devotion.\nThe Lord is Time, the reckoner. Time embodies all actions and brings forth their effects inevitably. Time is precious, and the seekers have to use it most carefully for their self-purification and spiritual advancement.\nWe find that beasts and birds are mentioned among the highest manifestations of the Lord. Gajendra is an elephant, Garuda is a bird – and yet they could attain Divinity by their devotion. Will it then be anything impossible for a rational man to attain the highest state? Turning away from material things of momentary nature, let all men realise the divinity of their real Self.\nBhagavad Gita: Chapter 10 🔻\n(42 Verses)\n01\n02\n03\n04\n05\n06\n07\n08\n09\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42",

Women are not weak; they have also in them the Divinity that lifts them up to the plane of spiritual realisation. The point to note is that where these qualities are found, there the Lord is.\nThe second line of the verse is interpreted in another way. Prasuti, the daughter of Svayambhuva Manu, married Dakshaprajapati, and to them were born twenty-four daughters. Among them there are Kirti Devi, Medha Devi, Dhriti Devi, Smriti Devi and Kshama Devi. Sri Devi is the daughter of Bhrigu. Vagdevi is the daughter of Brahma (creator). These seven are the presiding Deities of the seven virtues. The Lord here declares that He is all these seven feminine virtues. Whatever the interpretation maybe it is clear that the functioning of these virtues is due to the Lord Himself.\nThis verse is an inspiring call to women to give up all superstitious notions about their weakness or lowness, and stand up to realise what is their birth-right along with men and Gods.\nBhagavad Gita: Chapter 10 🔻\n(42 Verses)\n01\n02\n03\n04\n05\n06\n07\n08\n09\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42",

Every being is the manifestation of the Lord, even as the plant is just the manifestation of the seed. One should assert always the Divinity that exists everywhere. He should proclaim the Divinity in himself and in all others. This is the way to progress and realisation. All this is verily the Lord Himself. There cannot be any surer way to lift man from the vile state of weakness that the determined affirmation of his divine origin and his Divine destiny.

In some places there is a manifestation of the power of Knowledge; in others, of the power of ignorance. In some places there is a greater manifestation of power than in others. Don’t you see that among human beings there are cheats and gamblers, to say nothing of men who are like tigers. I think of them as the ‘cheat God’, the ‘tiger God’.” …….\n“What is vijnana? It is knowing God in a special way. The awareness and conviction that fire exists in wood is jnana, knowledge. But to cook rice on that fire, eat the rice, and get nourishment from it is vijnana. To know by one’s inner experience that God exists is jnana. But to talk to Him, to enjoy Him as Child, as Friend, as Master, as Beloved, is vijnana. The realisation that God alone has become the universe and all living beings is vijnana.\n“According to one school of thought, God cannot be seen. Who sees whom? Is God outside you, that you can see Him? One sees only oneself.

    "translation": "There is no end of My divine manifestations, Ο dreaded Arjuna. This is but a partial statement by Me of the multiplicity of My attributes.",
    "commentary": "The Lord is Infinite and hence His Glory cannot have an end.\nSwami Vivekananda Says —\nSo far the idea is that it is all One Infinite Being. That is the real individuality, when there is no more division, and no more parts; these little ideas are very low, illusive.\nBut yet in and through every spark of the individuality is shining that Infinite. Everything is a manifestation of the Atman.\nHow to reach that? First you make the statement, just as Yajnavalkya himself tells us: “This Atman is first to be heard of.” So he stated the case; then he argued it out, and the last demonstration was how to know That, through which all knowledge is possible. Then, last, it is to be meditated upon. He takes the contrast, the microcosm and the macrocosm, and shows how they are rolling on in particular lines, and how it is all beautiful. “This earth is so blissful, so helpful to every being; and all beings are so helpful to this earth: all these are manifestations of that Self-effulgent One, the Atman.” All that is bliss, even in the lowest sense, is but the reflection of Him. All that is good is His reflection, and when that reflection is a shadow it is called evil. There are no two Gods. When He is less manifested, it is called darkness, evil; and when He is more manifested, it is called light. That is all. Good and evil are only a question of degree: more manifested or less manifested. Just take the example of our own lives. How many things we see in our childhood which we think to be good, but which really are evil, and how many things seem to be evil which are good! How the ideas change! How an idea goes up and up! What we thought very good at one time we do not think so good now. So good and evil are but superstitions, and do not exist. The difference is only in degree. It is all a manifestation of that Atman; He is being manifested in everything; only, when the manifestation is very thick we call it evil; and when it is very thin, we call it good. It is the best, when all covering goes away. So everything that is in the universe is to be meditated upon in that sense alone, that we can see it as all good, because it is the best. There is evil and there is good; and the apex, the centre, is the Reality. He is neither evil nor good; He is the best. The best can be only one, the good can be many and the evil many. There will be degrees of variation between the good and the evil, but the best is only one, and that best, when seen through thin coverings, we call different sorts of good, and when through thick covers, we call evil. Good and evil are different forms of superstition. They have gone through all sorts of dualistic delusion and all sorts of ideas, and the words have sunk into the hearts of human beings, terrorising men and women and living there as terrible tyrants. They make us become tigers. All the hatred with which we hate others is caused by these foolish ideas which we have imbibed since our childhood — good and evil. Our judgment of humanity becomes entirely false; we make this beautiful earth a hell; but as soon as we can give up good and evil, it becomes a heaven.\n(Source)\nObjective society will always be a mixture of good and evil — objective life will always be followed by its shadow death, and the longer the life, the longer will also be the shadow. It is only when the sun is on our own head that\nthere is no shadow\n. When God and good and everything else is in us, there is no evil. In objective life, however, every bullet has its billet — evil goes with every good as its shadow. Every improvement is coupled with an equal degradation. The reason being that good and evil are not two things but one, the difference being only in manifestation — one of degree, not kind.\n(Source)\nThe difference between man and man, and all things in the whole creation, is not in kind but only in degree. The background, the reality, of everyone is that same Eternal, Ever Blessed, Ever Pure, and Ever Perfect One. It is the Atman, the Soul, in the saint and the sinner, in the happy and the miserable, in the beautiful and the ugly, in men and in animals; it is the same throughout. It is the shining One. The difference is caused by the power of expression. In some It is expressed more, in others less, but this difference of expression has no effect upon the Atman.\n(Source)\nNow that which we call matter and mind are one and the same substance. The only difference is in the degree of vibration. Mind at a very low rate of vibration is what is known as matter. Matter at a high rate of vibration is what is known as mind. Both are the same substance; and therefore, as matter is bound by time and space and causation, mind which is matter at a high rate of vibration is bound by the same law. Nature is homogeneous. Differentiation is in manifestation. The Sanskrit word for nature is Prakriti, and means literally differentiation. All is one substance, but it is manifested variously. Mind becomes matter, and matter in its turn becomes mind, it is simply a question of vibration.\n(Source)\nBoth matter and mind are really nothing but forces; and if you analyse them far enough, you will find that at root they are one. The very fact that the external force can somehow evoke the internal force shows that somewhere they join each other — they must be continuous and, therefore, basically the same force. When you get to the root of things, they become simple and general. Since the same force appears in one form as matter and in another form as mind, there is no reason to think matter and mind are different. Mind is changed into matter, matter is changed into mind. Thought force becomes nerve force, muscular force; muscular and nerve force become thought force. Nature is all this force, whether expressed as matter or mind. The difference between the subtlest mind and the grossest matter is only one of degree. Therefore the whole universe may be called either mind or matter, it does not matter which. You may call the mind refined matter, or the body concretised mind; it makes little difference by which name you call which. All the troubles arising from the conflict between materialism and spirituality are due to wrong thinking. Actually, there is no difference between the two. I and the lowest pig differ only in degree. It is less manifested, I am more. Sometimes I am worse, the pig is better.\n(Source)\nThe Brahman, the God of the Vedanta, has nothing outside of Himself; nothing at all. All this indeed is He: He is in the universe: He is the universe Himself. “Thou art the man, Thou art the woman, Thou art the young man walking in the pride of youth, Thou art the old man tottering in his step.” He is here. Him we see and feel: in Him we live, and move, and have our being. You have that conception in the New Testament. It is that idea, God immanent in the universe, the very essence, the heart, the soul of things. He manifests Himself, as it were, in this universe. You and I are little bits, little points, little channels, little expressions, all living inside of that infinite ocean of Existence, Knowledge, and Bliss. The difference between man and man, between angels and man, between man and animals, between animals and plants, between plants and stones is not in kind, because everyone from the highest angel to the lowest particle of matter is but an expression of that one infinite ocean, and the difference is only in degree.\n(Source)\nSri Ramakrishna Says —\n“I once said to Keshab, ‘How can a typhoid patient be cured if he remains in a room where a pitcher of water and a jar of pickles are kept?’ Now and then one should live in solitude.”\nA DEVOTEE:\n“Sir, what do you think of the Navavidhan? It seems to me like a hotchpotch of everything.”\nMASTER:\n“Some say it is a modern thing. That sets me wondering: ‘Then is the God of the Brahmo Samaj a new God?’ The Brahmos speak of their cult as the Navavidhan, as a New Dispensation. Well, it may be so. Who knows? There are six systems of philosophy; so perhaps it is like one of these.\n“But do you know where those who speak of the formless God make their mistake? It is where they say that God is formless only, and that those who differ with them are wrong.\n“But I know that God is both with and without form. And He may have many more aspects. It is possible for Him to be everything.\n(To Ishan) “The Chitsakti, Mahamaya, has become the twenty-four cosmic principles. One day as I was meditating, my mind wandered away to Rashkē’s house. He is a scavenger. I said to my mind, ‘Stay there, you rogue!’ The Divine Mother revealed to me that the men and women in this house were mere masks; inside them was the same Divine Power, Kundalini, that rises up through the six spiritual centres of the body.\n“Is the Primal Energy man or woman? Once at Kamarpukur I saw the worship of Kali in the house of the Lahas. They put a sacred thread\n9\non the image of the Divine Mother. One man asked, ‘Why have they put the sacred thread on the Mother’s person?’ The master of the house said: Brother, I see that you have rightly understood the Mother. But I do not yet know whether the Divine Mother is male or female.’\n“It is said that Mahamaya swallowed Siva. When the six centres in Her Were awakened, Siva came out through Her thigh. Then Siva created the Tantra philosophy.\n“Take refuge in the Chitsakti, the Mahamaya.”\nISHAN:\n“Please bestow your grace on me.” (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\n—–\nWater and a bubble on it are one and the same. The bubble has its birth in the water, floats on it, and is ultimately resolved into it. So also the Jivatman and the Paramatman are one and the same, the difference between them being only one of degree. For one is finite and limited while the other is infinite; one is dependent while the other is independent.\n(Source: The Sayings of Sri Ramakrishna)\nAll beings are unmanifest in their beginning, O Bhārata, manifest in their middle state, and unmanifest again in their end. Why, then, lament for them? (\nBG 2.28\n)\nThis entire cosmic manifestation is pervaded by Me in My unmanifest form. All living beings dwell in Me, but I do not dwell in them. (\nBG 9.4\n)\nThe Rishi said: Nisumbha was killed and Sumbha lying down on the ground could not bear this insult to his kingly honour. With uncontrollable anger, he cried out at Devi, “O weak and wicked Durga! Do not be proud. You are fighting with the help of somebody else.” The Devi said, “I am alone and single in this world. Who is there other than Me here? See, all these many fighting with you are Myself. Now look at Me.” As soon as Devi uttered these words, all those appearances of many entered into the body of Durga, and there was none but Devi, the Single. Devi again said, “Be calm. I alone with the power of immanence and omnipresence appeared as many but now stand single and have withdrawn myself into Myself.” (Source: Sri Durga Saptashati or The Devi Mahatmya (The Glory of The Divine Mother) by Swami Sivananda)\nBhagavad Gita: Chapter 10 🔻\n(42 Verses)\n01\n02\n03\n04\n05\n06\n07\n08\n09\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42",

    "commentary": "Whatever there is good – the profusion of knowledge, purity of heart, righteousness, beauty, power and splendour – all that is only a manifested fragment of the Lord’s glory. All talents, all faculties, all arts and sciences, all intelligence, order, discipline, all that is admirable, grand, great and splendid, are the manifestations of the Lord’s glory. Let no man imagine that he has anything to be proud of. If he has prosperity, that prosperity is the Lord’s; if he has power and intelligence, all that is the Lord’s; if he has genius that genius is the Lord’s. He who thinks that they are his own possessions is guilty of misappropriating the Lord’s plenty, and should suffer the penalty of loss and bereavement. These great attributes of the Lord should be contemplated continuously, so that they may become part and parcel of one’s own nature and lead him to union with the Lord.\nSwami Vivekananda Says —\nWhatever is pleasure and happiness and light in the universe belongs to Purusha; but it is a compound, because it is Purusha plus Prakriti. “Wherever there is any happiness, wherever there is any bliss, there is a spark of that immortality which is God.”\n[Source]\nWhenever the world goes down, the Lord comes to help it forward; and so He does from time to time and place to place. In another passage He speaks to this effect: Wherever thou findest a great soul of immense power and purity struggling to raise humanity, know that he is born of My splendour, that I am there working through him.\n[Source]\nI will find you the answer in the words of Krishna himself: “Whenever virtue subsides and irreligion prevails, I come down. Again and again I come. Therefore, whenever thou seest a great soul struggling to uplift mankind, know that I am come, and worship.”\n[Source]\nIt is the same light coming through glasses of different colours. And these little variations are necessary for purposes of adaptation. But in the heart of everything the same truth reigns. The Lord has declared to the Hindu in His incarnation as Krishna, “I am in every religion as the thread through a string of pearls. Wherever thou seest extraordinary holiness and extraordinary power raising and purifying humanity, know thou that I am there.” And what has been the result? I challenge the world to find, throughout the whole system of Sanskrit philosophy, any such expression as that the Hindu alone will be saved and not others.\n[Source]\nThis our sages knew, and, therefore, left it open to all Indian people to worship such great personages, such Incarnations. Nay, the greatest of these Incarnations goes further: “Wherever an extraordinary spiritual power is manifested by external man, know that I am there; it is from Me that that manifestation comes.” That leaves the door open for the Hindu to worship the Incarnations of all the countries in the world. The Hindu can worship any sage and any saint from any country whatsoever, and as a fact we know that we go and worship many times in the churches of the Christians, and many, many times in the Mohammedan mosques, and that is good. Why not? Ours, as I have said, is the universal religion. It is inclusive enough, it is broad enough to include all the ideals. All the ideals of religion that already exist in the world can be immediately included, and we can patiently wait for all the ideals that are to come in the future to be taken in the same fashion, embraced in the infinite arms of the religion of the Vedanta.\n[Source]\nSri Ramakrishna Says —\nMASTER (\nto Nanda\n):\n“According to the\nGita\na man who is honoured and respected by many people possesses a special power of God. You have divine power.”\nNANDA:\n“All men have the same power.”\nMASTER (\nsharply\n): “You all say the same thing. Can all men ever possess power to the same degree? God no doubt dwells in all beings as the all-pervading Spirit, but the manifestations of His Power are different in different beings.\n“Vidyasagar, too, said the same thing. He said, ‘Has God given some more power and some less?’ Thereupon I said to him: ‘If there are not different manifestations of His Power, then why have we come to see you? Have you grown two horns on your head?'” (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\nThe Master was highly pleased with the ostad’s music. He said to the musician, “There is a special manifestation of God’s power in a man who has any outstanding gift, such as proficiency in music.”\n(",

    "commentary": "The Lord ends this Discourse by declaring that there is no use of the detailed enumeration of His Divine Glories, because they are infinite, and the infinite cannot be rendered in terms of the finite. The Lord then sums up the whole idea in a single proclamation that the whole universe, with everything in it, is only a fragment of His Glory. What contemplation, what imaginative flight, what understanding, what vision, can fathom and comprehend the Infinity of the Lord? These millions and millions of worlds are all pervaded by the Lord. His power is infinite.\nIn the presence of the Lord, what is man? Let him bow down to the Lord. Let him sing the Lord’s Glory. Let him offer himself up to the Lord. Let him live in the Lord, for there is nothing else but the Lord wherever he may turn. Egoism and pride have no place in the heart of the man who can think of the Lord’s Glory. His little strength, little good, little beauty, little power, are nothing indeed, nothing before the Glory of the Lord. Thus thinking man realises the truth that the Lord is All and he is himself a part of the Lord.\nSwami Vivekananda Says —\nAll that we see of God is only a part, just as we see only one portion of the universe, and all the rest is beyond human cognition. “I, the universal; so great am I that even this universe is but a part of Me.” That is why we see God as imperfect, and do not understand Him. The only way to understand Him and the universe is to go beyond reason, beyond consciousness.\n[Source]\nBe brave and be sincere; then follow any path with devotion, and you must reach the Whole. Once lay hold of one link of the chain, and the whole chain must come by degrees.\n[\nSource\n]\nSri Ramakrishna Says —\nSHRISH: ”God exists and He alone does everything. But the attributes we ascribe to Him are not the right ones. How can a man conceive of Him? His nature is infinite.”\nMASTER: ”What need is there of your counting the number of trees and branches in an orchard? You have come to the orchard to eat mangoes. Do that and be happy. The aim of human birth is to love God. Realize that love and be at peace.\n“Suppose you have entered a tavern for a drink. Is it necessary for you to know how many gallons of wine there are in the tavern? One glass is enough for you. What need is there of your knowing the infinite qualities of God? You may discriminate for millions of years about God’s attributes and still you will not know them.”\n[Source]\n—-\nThe pundit had studied the Vedas and the other scriptures. He loved to discuss philosophy. The Master, seated on the couch, cast his benign look on the pundit and gave him counsel through parables.\nMASTER (to the pundit): “There are many scriptures like the Vedas. But one cannot realize God without austerity and spiritual discipline. ‘God cannot be found in the six systems, the Vedas, or the Tantra.’\n“But one should learn the contents of the scriptures and then act according to their injunctions. A man lost a letter. He couldn’t remember where he had left it. He began to search for it with a lamp. After two or three people had searched, the letter was at last found. The message in the letter was: ‘Please send us five seers of sandesh and a piece of wearing-cloth.’ The man read it and then threw the letter away. There was no further need of it; now all he had to do was to buy the five seers of sandesh and the piece of cloth.\n[Source]\n—-\nMASTER (\nsmiling\n):\n“What will a man gain by knowing many scriptures? The one thing needful is to know how to cross the river of the world. God alone is real, and all else illusory.\n“While Arjuna was aiming his arrow at the eye of the bird, Drona asked him: ‘What do you see? Do you see these kings?’ ‘No, sir’, replied Arjuna. ‘Do you see me?’ ‘No.’ ‘The tree?’ ‘No.’ ‘The bird on the tree?’ ‘No.’ ‘What do you see then?’ ‘Only the eye of the bird.’\n“He who sees only the eye of the bird can hit the mark. He alone is clever who sees that God is real and all else is illusory. What need have I of other information? Hanuman once remarked: ‘I don’t know anything about the phase of the moon or the position of the stars. I only contemplate Rama.’ (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\nOne evening when Swami Vivekananda was returning from Dakshineswar with\nDevendra\n, he said to him: “Look at the Milky Way. It is just like a stream of milk. Do you know that every moment millions of suns and moons are being formed within it? That is the source of the stars. Just imagine what an inconceivable Being is the ruler of this vast universe! And a tiny man with his limited intellect is trying to fathom and comprehend Him! Is He so easily obtainable?” After listening to Swamiji, Devendra was absorbed in the thought of the Infinite. He then concluded that it was not possible for a man to realize God. This greatly troubled him, and he could not sleep for three days. At last he went to\nGirish\nand told him the cause of his anxiety. Girish said to him: “But it is also true that the Ruler of this universe, from whom this cosmic creation evolves, incarnates Himself in a human body and gives liberation to sinners like us.” Devendra was relieved to hear this, and his mind became calm again.\n[",
