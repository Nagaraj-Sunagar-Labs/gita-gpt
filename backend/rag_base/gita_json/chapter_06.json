    "translation": "He who performs the prescribed duty without depending on the fruits of work is a sannyasi and a yogi, and not he who has merely ceased performing sacrifices such as Agnihotra yajna or abandoned bodily activities.",
    "commentary": "Some people think that one who wears the ochre robes is a sannyasi. Others think that one who lives in solitude in a mountain cave, having given up all work is a yogi. These are external things only. conditions. No one can claim to be a sannyasi or yogi by these externals The inner impurities of the mind should be cleared, the attachment should be given up, and the desire for enjoyment should be relinquished. Inner purification comes first, and then only external renunciation. It is only then that one may rightly be recognised as a Sannyasi or Yogi.\nThe real attributes of a perfected sage are the performance of prescribed duties and action without desire for the fruits of work.\nFreedom from attachment of any kind is the sine quo non of a sannyasi. Desireless performance of good work is the mark of a yogi. The Lord emphatically condemns the idlers and pretenders who are neither useful citizens nor enlightened guides of the community.\nDuty prescribed by the Sastras:\nAction is here qualified by the condition that it should conform to the laws of Dharma. What is contrary to Dharma is not advisable (Karyam). Righteous deeds and these also performed without the desire to enjoy the fruits is the law of Action. Anyone who acts according to this law is indeed a sannyasi and he attains the highest reward of liberation.\nThe difference in caste or Asrama is not mentioned here. The fulfillment of the conditions of Dharma, and non-attachment are the only characteristics of sannyasa or yoga.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda\nSwami Turiyananda: Shri Ramakrishna used to say that one be-comes fit for Sannyasa only by having been a king in a previous birth and enjoyed life. Then only is one imbued with true dispassionateness from the very beginning of life. Is Sannyasa a mere form? Our idea was that a Sannyasin is very rare. For no ordinary man is he whom Mâyâ has released from her bondage. When I saw three thousand monks at Rishikesh, then did I truly feel the difference between a true and a formal monk. A mere ochre garb does not constitute Sannyasa.\n“They want Sannyasa early in order to evade work. Our Master did not emphasize Sannyasa so much as realizing God. But it is true he was emphatic that knowledge of God is not possible without renunciation.”",

    "translation": "O Arjuna! That which is called sannyasa, know that to be yoga also; no one who has not given up desire can ever become a yogi.",
    "commentary": "By sharp discrimination between the Self and non-Self, the Jnanayogi rejects anatma (non-self) and establishes himself in the Supreme Reality. The Karma yogi acts without any feeling of doership, without desire, without the sense of ‘I’ and ‘Mine’, and surrenders his work with its fruits to God. So acting he lives in the Supreme Reality. The Jnana yogi follows the path of introspection into himself by eliminating the senses the mind and the external world. The Bhakti yogi has no relish for anything in the world, and he contemplates the Lord repeating His name, singing His glories, and thus lives in bliss and blessedness.\nIn this way whatever path man may follow – Jnana, Karma, Bhakti, Dhyana – the inner principle is the same (i.e.) the rejection of insentient material things. Besides this, life in the Divine is implicit in all these yogas. That is why the Lord teaches that sannyasa and yoga are the same in their goal and aim.\nNo one who has not renounced desire, the ego-centric initiative (samkalpa) for possessing material things, can ever become a yogi. Without the renunciation of desire, to live an idle and aimless life is neither sannyasa nor yoga.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda",

    "translation": "For the sage aspiring to ascend to yoga, action is said to be the means; and for the same sage enthroned in yoga serenity is called the means.",
    "commentary": "To achieve success in Jnanayoga or Dhyana yoga, action (Nishkamakarma) is said to be the means. When success is attained in yoga and the mind approaches steadiness in the Self, a quiescent state free from action (sama) is said to be the means for deeper union with the Self. Therefore in the early stages of meditation purity has to be acquired by the practice of Nishkama karma. Afterward, as the mind becomes firm and steady by its purity, action should be gradually reduced. It means that as the aspirant approaches the Self nearer and nearer, action drops off of its own accord, even as dry leaves fall from the tree. The field of activity is thus transferred from the external world to the inner realm of the human personality. Hearing of Atma, thinking of Atma, meditating on Atma (sravana, munana, nidhidhyasa) – the seeker is disinclined to come out of the inner pursuit to active functions of the outer world with the body and the senses. He finds supreme satisfaction in being absorbed in the Self. The turbulence of the bodily organs and the senses is quelled. The seeker has no use for them because the mind and the intellect are turned within and the ascent towards the Self is maintained steadily. Such quietude of the physical and mental mechanism will enable him ultimately to reach the state where there are no thought modifications, and the Self is directly realised.\nLet the seekers understand the position correctly. Hasty attempts to go into meditation will be of no avail. The mind rarely falls quiet for the common man. The inherent ‘vasanas’ pull him out into the external world of action. It requires great effort to purify the mind before it can attain a calm and peaceful state when meditation becomes possible. So the seeker should first engage himself in righteous and devotional acts. Otherwise, he remains dull and inactive, and dullness of the brain is certainly not meditation. Meditation is an intensely active state when all the energies of man are gathered together and centered in the one thought of the Self. To stop action by force and drive the mind by violent effort would unhinge the personality and render it more restless and distracted. When the wound is healing, a layer of skin covers it, but if one scratches it away before the wound is completely cured, it causes another blister. The layer should drop off naturally. So also, all actions are reduced by a natural process when the mind gathers momentum in its inward pursuit of the Self.\nThe path of progress may be divided into three stages: 1. The aspirant who is seeking yoga comes under the first stage – (the High – School Course). 2. The second stage is reached when meditation becomes possible by the purity of mind (Graduate Course). 3. Undisturbed absorption in the Self is the final stage (Post-Graduate Course). So the progress is gradual, not sudden and violent. First, through Nishkamakarma the mind should be purified. Then the practice of meditation should start. Then meditation should become deeper and deeper till the Self is realised. As a man reaches the third stage, all actions appear burdensome, and his only aim would be to get firmly established in the Self. He is the ‘Yogarudha’.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda\nExcerpt from ‘Spiritual Treasures: Letters of Swami Turiyananda’ —\nWe obstruct the path of our progress by limiting ourselves with rules. Of course, I am not saying there is no need for rules. It is important to know when rules are necessary and when they are not.\nWith great effort we invoke the deity in an image; yet we immerse the image after the worship. It is like a change of arrangement according to the change of situation. But, undoubtedly, it is difficult to ascertain. This is certain: If we can surrender ourselves fully to the Lord, we will not have to repent for anything. By God’s grace, everything will be all right. Don’t worry. Take refuge in God. Take refuge in God.

    "translation": "When the sage feels no attachment for sense-objects and actions, renouncing the ego-centric will (\nsamkalpa\n) then he is said to be enthroned in yoga.",
    "commentary": "The words ‘\nyada\n‘ and ‘\ntada\n‘ are used to point out the exact moment when a sage is called a ‘Yogarudha’. Three conditions are to be fulfilled.\nNon-attachment to sense-objects\nNon-attachment to actions.\nRenunciation of all thoughts.\nSo long as the mind is attached to sense objects, it runs outwards for the enjoyment of worldly pleasures. When the mind does not turn inwards, meditation is not possible. When dispassion develops, the outgoing tendency of the mind stops, and then it can easily be trained to look for the Self within, Nishkamakarma develops dispassion.\nWhen the mind finds happiness in Atma, man loses all pleasure in action. Moreover, as the mind is detached from the senses no action can take place, because contact with the external world is possible only through the senses. Actionlessness occurs in the higher stages of Sadhana. Some great sages who have passed beyond all relative thoughts, and are established in perfect Yoga, come down from that supreme state to act in the world for the good of humanity.\nRenunciation of the ego-centric will is the third attribute of the Yogarudha. First of all bad thoughts should be replaced by good thoughts and then all thoughts should be given up. When there are no thoughts, the sage is enthroned in Yoga, union with the Self. The common man should complete the preliminary education of the mind to give up impure and sinful thoughts. Noble ideals, good aims, useful activity, selfless work – all these should be assiduously cultivated. There is no other way to purify the mind. The study of the Sastras, the company of holy men, association with good people, are helpful to strengthen the good and eliminate the evil. Divine and devotional thoughts and feelings should become natural to the mind.\nAfterward, when the mind, through intense meditation, reach the Self and tastes the infinite bliss, good thoughts also come to an end. When the mind, merges in Atma, Atma alone exists. This is the thought-free state of the Yogarudha.\nIt is not emptiness or nothingness, because, in the thought-free state, the all-pervading knowledge consciousness is fully awake though there is no mind.\nSome great sages who come down to the relative plane of the mind work for the good of mankind.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda",

    "commentary": "The same idea as in the previous\nverse\nis elaborated here. Friend and foe are both inside man. The subdued mind is a friend, and the turbulent mind is the enemy.  External friends or enemies are not so loyal or persistent as the conquered mind. The mind subdued and kept under control is the greatest friend to lead one to eternal peace. Even so, the turbulent mind poisoned with lust and greed leads to destruction. So control of the mind is essential for spiritual progress.The word Atma in this context refers to the mind including the senses and the bodily organs.\nMind conquered by the self:\nMan has to conquer the lower self by the higher self.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda\nNo two people see the same world…Some people who begin by saying that the world is a hell, often end by saying that it is a heaven, when they succeed in the practice of Self-Control.\nIf you can conserve and use the energy properly, it leads you to God. Inverted, it is hell itself.\n[\nSource\n]\nWho can help the Infinite ?… Even the hand that comes to you through the darkness will have to be your own. (Source: Reminiscences of Swami Vivekananda)\n— Swami Vivekananda\nVivekachudamani, Verses 172-174:\n172. Clouds are brought in by the wind and again driven away by the same agency. Similarly, man’s bondage is caused by the mind, and Liberation too is caused by that alone.\n173. It (first) creates an attachment in man for the body and all other sense-objects, and binds him through that attachment like a beast by means of ropes. Afterwards, the selfsame mind creates in the individual an utter distaste for these sense-objects as if they were poison, and frees him from the bondage.\n174. Therefore the mind is the only cause that brings about man’s bondage or Liberation: when tainted by the effects of Rajas it leads to bondage, and when pure and divested of the Rajas and Tamas elements it conduces to Liberation.\nRelated Articles:\nMind is the only cause of bondage and liberation: attached to objects, it gives bondage – without them, liberation. —\nMaitrayini Upanishad",

Proud in the hour of praise, sullen in the hour of shame, elated in the hour of pleasure, depressed in the hour of pain, the mind goes through a constant wheel of different moods and passions. Every moment of life causes a peculiar change in mind. The ignorant man lives and dies under the sway of the turbulent and disturbed mind. He is never peaceful. Peace is the result of a restful state of mind. When the mind is in a state of restless ecstasy, there can be no taste of peace at all. But the mind of the sage is different. It is always in a state of balance, whatever changes may be happening outside, and rests in the infinite peace of Atma. As little waves and ripples of wind cannot shake a huge mountain, the pairs of opposites cannot move the man who has subdued the mind. He is always established in the Self and enjoys the bliss of Self. So by constant practice, the seeker has to keep the mind in a condition of immovable stability.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda",

Though there are several yogas, yet very rarely we come across a yogi of the highest realisation. The attributes of the perfected Yogi are mentioned here.\nOne who is satisfied with Jnana and Vignana:\nJnana and Vignana are mentioned separately in the Gita.\nJnana is understanding of the Self by the study of the Sastras, the teachings of the Guru and elders. Vijnana means direct Self-realisation. It is just the difference between theory and practice.\nOne may study the art of cooking from books, but this knowledge is not complete without practical experience. One should clearly understand the difference between the two. The scholar may imagine that he has attained self-realisation by his knowledge of the Sastras. No doubt the value of intellectual knowledge of Truth should not be under-estimated. But this should never be mistaken for Realisation. Realisation requires an absolute subdual of the senses, the mind, and the intellect, the elimination of all desires, and perfect peace in the Self. The words ‘\ntriptah\n‘, ‘\ntushtah\n‘ are used to show that the realised yogi is perfectly contented in the Self. Wealth and enjoyments, fame and name, power and position, do not lead to this undisturbed contentment in the Self. Everybody knows it. There is still a feeling of incompleteness. Having attained the Self, man knows that he has nothing else to seek for. He is contended forever.",

There are positively inimical people who may hate others and try to injure them in every possible way. Others are indifferent, and some others are neutral. Thus we come across different categories of people with different attitudes. The Yogi is equal-minded towards all these people. Towards the righteous and the unrighteous also he is equal-minded.\nHow is he able to maintain this equality of vision? It is clear that all these distinctions arise with reference to the ego which has identified itself with the body.\nThe ego-centric man is constantly reactionary to people according to their attitude towards him.\nIf they are friends, he like them. If they are harmful foes, he hates them. It is the bodily outlook (\ndehadrishti\n) that is the cause of all those distinctions.

    "commentary": "From this verse onwards, the practice of Dhyanayoga is explained in detail. Here the word ‘Yogi’ does not refer to one who has already attained perfection. It applies to those only who are seeking yoga (union with the Self). Five conditions are mentioned for the practice of Dhyanayoga- 1. Solitude, 2. Living in a lonely place, 3. Control of mind and body 4. Desirelessness 5 Non-receiving.\nStationed in a Solitary place:\nThe yogi should practise meditation in a lonely place. Pretenders who sit in yogic pose in public thoroughfares are cheats and beggars. The yogi practises meditation not to derive benefit or admiration from others. The aim of the yogi is to establish union between himself and God. So he should seek a solitary place where the mind is not distracted by the sights and sounds of worldly life. That is why the ancient sages sought for the solitude of mountain-caves and river-beds, to carry on their spiritual practice. The solitude of nature is itself a purifying influence, and the vast silence around induces the mood of meditation without much effort. The beauty of nature delights and calms the mind, and the turbulent impulses are subdued of their own accord. The house-holders can create solitude in their own homes by keeping a small enclosure for purposes of worship and dhyana. The images of saints and sages along with the Deity of family worship may be kept there and worshipped with flowers, incense, and camphor. Such a place will indeed be solitude. This is a liberal interpretation to undertake the practice of Dhyana for self-advancement.",

    "commentary": "The Gita gives complete instruction in all matters great and small. Here the Lord gives minute details of the place and the seat where Dhyana should be practised.\nThe place selected should be a clean spot. Keep the home clean and that shall become a fit place for meditation. Even in solitude, there may be unclean spots full of worms, germs and foul smell. Such a place is not fit for meditation. Let us understand how the Lord emphasises cleanliness. Some people think that the mind is more important than the place, and it does not matter whether the place is clean or not. It is wrong to think so. In an unclean place, unclean thoughts arise in the mind. In a home which is kept in perfect order, the mind functions in an orderly manner. Of course, when the man becomes a yogarudha, all places are the same. He can be absorbed in the Self at all places. But till that state is reached one must see that he selects only a clean spot.

    "translation": "In a clean spot, a firm seat should be made, neither too high nor too low, and it should be covered by cloth, skin, and holy grass one over the other.\nThere, being seated, having made the mind one-pointed, controlling the actions of the mind and the senses, let him practice Dhyana Yoga for self-purification.",
    "commentary": "The Gita gives complete instruction in all matters great and small. Here the Lord gives minute details of the place and the seat where Dhyana should be practised.\nThe place selected should be a clean spot. Keep the home clean and that shall become a fit place for meditation. Even in solitude, there may be unclean spots full of worms, germs and foul smell. Such a place is not fit for meditation. Let us understand how the Lord emphasises cleanliness. Some people think that the mind is more important than the place, and it does not matter whether the place is clean or not. It is wrong to think so. In an unclean place, unclean thoughts arise in the mind. In a home which is kept in perfect order, the mind functions in an orderly manner. Of course, when the man becomes a yogarudha, all places are the same. He can be absorbed in the Self at all places. But till that state is reached one must see that he selects only a clean spot. We do not come across any great soul living an unclean life either in body or mind, or speech.\nThe seat should not be too high or too low.

    "translation": "O Arjuna! Verily, yoga is not for one who eats too much or who does not eat at all, nor for him who sleeps too much or who does not sleep at all.",
    "commentary": "Moderation in food and sleep is the condition of yoga for all seekers whatever path they follow. In Dhyana Yoga particularly, it is of very great importance. Unless the body is light and strong, meditation is difficult to practise. So, regulation of food and sleep is prescribed as the first condition of yoga. Generally, people think that spirituality is something not connected with the body and what they eat and how they work does not matter. It is not so. The body if not regulated is itself the chief obstacle to spiritual realisation. A sickly body subject to pain binds the mind to itself and its suffering and does not allow it to rise to the plane of thought and meditation. We know that when the body is healthy and strong, the mind becomes free from the bondage of the body and becomes capable of higher thought and imagination. Regulation of the body is therefore emphasised many times in the Gita.\nModeration in sleep is also of great importance. Too much sleep produces ‘tamas’ and all the demonical forces in man find free play in that state. Even so, sleeplessness causes nervous breakdown, and man becomes unfit for any kind of work, much less for Dhyana.\nBhagavad Gita 6.16 to 6.17 by Swami Chetanananda\nSwami Vivekananda Says —\nA yogi must avoid the two extremes of luxury and austerity. He must not fast, nor torture his flesh. He who does so, says the Gita, cannot be a yogi: He who fasts, he who keeps awake, he who sleeps much, he who works too much, he who does no work, none of these can be a yogi.\n[Source]\nThe food must be simple and taken several times [a day] instead of once or twice. Never get very hungry. “He who eats too much cannot be a yogi. He who fasts too much cannot be a yogi. He who sleeps too much cannot be a yogi, nor he who keeps awake too much.” He who does not do any work and he who works too hard cannot succeed. Proper food, proper exercise, proper sleep, proper wakefulness — these are necessary for any success.\n[Source]\nThe body must be properly taken care of. The people who torture their flesh are demoniacal. Always keep your mind joyful; if melancholy thoughts come, kick them out. A yogi must not eat too much, but he also must not fast; he must not sleep too much, but he must not go without any sleep. In all things only the man who holds the golden mean can become a yogi.\n[Source]\nThe explanation of nature is in us; the stone falls outside, but gravitation is in us, not outside. Those who stuff themselves, those who starve themselves, those who sleep too much, those who sleep too little, cannot become yogis. Ignorance, fickleness, jealousy, laziness, and excessive attachment are the great enemies to success in yoga practice.\n[Source]\n“He who has controlled the tongue, has controlled all other senses,” says the Bhagavata. In the early days at Dakshineswar, Latu (\nSwami Adbhutananda\n) used to wrestle and had a large appetite. One day he went to a devotee’s house in Calcutta and ate an exceptional quantity of food. The next day in front of the Master that devotee praised Latu’s power of consuming food. Later, the Master told Latu privately: “Look, it is not good to eat excessively by competing with others. During lunch, you may eat as much as you wish; but at night, don’t eat too much.” Latu obeyed his Master’s advice. Gradually he reduced his meals to such an extent that his body became emaciated. The Master observed this and told Latu:\n“Look, you have gone to the other extreme. Please eat the amount that will keep your body in fit condition. Otherwise, if you eat too little you won’t be able to focus your mind during meditation.”\n(Source: God Lived with Them)",

    "translation": "For him who is moderate in food and recreation, moderate in exertion in all actions, moderate in sleep and wakefulness, yoga destroys all pain and suffering (caused by birth and death).",
    "commentary": "“Be moderate, avoid excess in all things” – This is the Lord’s command. Yoga then destroys all suffering. So if a man suffers, the cause for it is excessive indulgence in some form or other.\nSelf-control actually means the power by which man can order the body and mind to function according to the highest spiritual laws.\nThere is no self-control for the man whose body and mind act in their own way in defiance of the spiritual laws. This principle holds good in Dhyanayoga. Enthusiastic beginners, with more zeal than wisdom, overdo the sadhana and consequently suffer discomfort and pain, and then they give up the practice altogether thinking that they are not fit for it.\nOverdoing a good thing is as harmful as indulgence in bad things.\nYoung students burn midnight oil to prepare for the examinations, and in writing the examination, they become exhausted and their whole work goes in vain. Even if they pass the examination, the after-effects of over-exertion cause some disease or other. So also in spiritual Sadhana the progress should be slow, steady, and sure. Over-exertion defeats the very purpose of yoga. Ascetic torture of the body by fasting too much and sleeplessness is not the way of yoga. A moderate way of life is yoga. The golden mean is yoga. Harmony and balance is yoga. It shows that a man can practice yoga while engaged in all the activities of life by strictly adhering to the law of moderation. In fact the body itself is made and sustained on the principle of harmony, balance and moderation. Excess of heat burns it, excess of cold stiffens it. The eyes cannot see when there is an excess light; in total darkness also they; cannot see. Extremes are alike. Moderate light and warmth are necessary for the proper functioning of the body. The analogy may be extended to the realm of the mind also. Excess of study dulls the brain, and causes fatigue and nervous disorders. Excess of emotion causes insanity. The nervous system breaks down by agitation and mental conflict. So moderation and harmony are the very principles of man’s existence. It is the law of nature. Yoga (Dhyanayoga) is possible only for the man who avoids excess in all activities of life. The yogi transcends all suffering by yoga.",

    "commentary": "When the mind is merged in Atma, that very moment man attains Moksha, liberation from all the ills and evils of human existence. Three aspects of Yogasiddhi are mentioned here – (1) Desirelessness, (2) Control of mind, and (3) Union with Atma. The same process is stated in Vedanta in different terminology (1) Vasanakshaya, (2) Manonasa, and (3) Tattvajnana. One is actioned by the others (i.e.) by the elimination of all desires mind ceases to exist, and the Atmajnana is realised. When Atmajnana dawns the mind with all its propensity for material enjoyment is destroyed.\nDesires are the shackles that bind man to samsara. When these desires disturb the mind, Dhyana is not possible. When by discrimination and dispassion, desires are rooted out, the pure mind automatically merges in Atma which is the source from which it has risen. All the desires without any reservation should be given up.\nThe mind should be brought to one focal point and remain steady at that point, namely the Self. The least distraction draws it away from the object of meditation.\nThe mind should rest in Atma alone, to the complete exclusion of everything else. When there are no desires and distractions, the mind by itself comes to rest in its own source-Atma.\nSuch a yogi who rests steadfastly in Atma is Yogarudha. He is united with the supreme Self.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda\nMind of a Yogi by Swami Atmapriyananda\nSri Ramakrishna Says —\nSri Ramakrishna:\n“Some are born with the characteristics of the yogi; but they too should be careful. It is ‘woman and gold’ alone that is the obstacle; it makes them deviate from the path of yoga and drags them into worldliness. Perhaps they have some desire for enjoyment. After fulfilling their desire, they again direct their minds to God and thus recover their former state of mind, fit for the practise of yoga.\n….. “Unless the mind becomes steady there cannot be yoga. It is the wind of worldliness that always disturbs the mind, which may be likened to a candle-flame. If that flame doesn’t move at all, then one is said to have attained yoga.\n‘Woman and gold’ alone is the obstacle to ‘yoga. Always analyse what you see. What is there in the body of a woman? Only such things as blood, flesh, fat, entrails, and the like. Why should one love such a body? ….\n“\nThe mind of the yogi is always fixed on God, always absorbed in the Self. You can recognize such a man by merely looking at him. His eyes are wide open, with an aimless look, like. the eyes of the mother bird hatching her eggs. Her entire mind is fixed on the eggs, and there is a vacant look in her eyes.\nCan you show me such a picture?”\nM:\n“I shall try to get one.” (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\nRelated Articles:\nThe harmonised yogi who knows the essence of things, thinks “I do nothing”, seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, eating, moving, sleeping, breathing, speaking, giving, grasping, opening, and closing the eyelids even. He is convinced that the senses move among the objects of the senses. (\nBG 5.8 & 5.9\n)\nHe who acts placing all actions in the eternal Brahman, giving up attachment, is unaffected by sin like the lotus by water. (\nBG 5.10\n)\nWhenever and wherever the restless and unsteady mind wanders, one should bring it back and continually focus it on God. (\nBG 6.26\n)",

    "commentary": "The mind of the yogi in meditation is compared to a steady light kept in a windless place. The illustration is fascinating and appropriate. Like the lamp, the mind of the yogi is effulgent with the light of knowledge, and it is also steady. The windows of the senses through which the objective world gets into the mind causing destruction are closed by perfect self-control, and so the mind remains steady and firm in meditation. Just as the orb of the Sun is clearly reflected in a pure calm lake when there are no ripples or waves, so also the Self is clearly reflected in a pure calm mind. The impure mind is unsteady and restless due to the winds of desire blowing constantly, like the light placed in a windy place.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda\nSri Ramakrishna Says —\nIn order to perform the worship of God you will be preoccupied for a long time with such religious duties as plucking flowers, making sandal-paste, polishing the utensils of worship, and arranging offerings. As you perform these duties your mind will naturally be directed to God. You will get rid of meanness, anger, jealousy, and so forth. When you two sisters talk to each other, always talk about spiritual matters.\n“The thing is somehow to unite the mind with God. You must not forget Him, not even once. Your thought of Him should be like the flow of oil, without any interruption. It you worship with love even a brick or stone as God, then through His grace you can see Him.\n“Remember what I have just said to you. One should perform such worship as the Siva Puja. Once the mind has become mature, one doesn’t have to continue formal worship for long (\nBG 3.17\n,\nBG 3.18\n). The mind then always remains united with God; meditation and contemplation become a constant habit of mind.” (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\n—–\n“When I meditated during my sadhana, I used to think of the unflickering flame of a lamp set in a windless place.\n“In deep meditation a man is not at all conscious of the outer world. A hunter was aiming at a bird. A bridal procession passed along beside him, with the groom’s relatives and friends, music, carriages, and horses. It took a long time for the procession to pass the hunter, but he was not at all conscious of it. He did not know that the bridegroom had gone by.\n“A man was angling in a lake all by himself. After a long while the float began to move. Now and then its tip touched the water. The angler was holding the rod tight in his hands, ready to pull it up, when a passer-by stopped and said, ‘Sir, can you tell me where Mr. Bannerji lives?’ There was no reply from the angler, who was just on the point of pulling up the rod. Again and again the stranger said to him in a loud voice, ‘Sir, can you tell me where Mr. Bannerji lives?’ But the angler was unconscious of everything around him. His hands were trembling, his eyes fixed on the float. The stranger was annoyed and went on. When he had gone quite a way, the angler’s float sank under water and with one pull of the rod he landed the fish. He wiped the sweat from his face with his towel and shouted after the stranger. ‘Hey!’ he said. ‘Come here! Listen!’ But the man would not turn his face. After much shouting, however, he came back and” said to the angler, ‘Why are you shouting at me?’ ‘What did you ask me about? said the angler. The stranger said,. ‘I repeated the question so many times, and now you are asking me to repeat it once more!’ The angler replied, ‘At that time my float was about to sink; so I didn’t hear a word of what you said.’\n“A person can achieve such single-mindedness in meditation that he will see nothing, hear nothing. He will not be conscious even of touch. A snake may crawl over his body, but he will not know it. Neither of them will be aware of the other.\n“In deep meditation the sense-organs stop functioning; the mind does not look outward. It is like closing the gate of the outer court in a house. There are five objects of the senses: form, taste, smell, touch, and sound. They are all left outside.\n“At the beginning of meditation the objects of the senses appear before the aspirant. But when the meditation becomes deep, they no longer bother him. They are left outside. How many things I saw during meditation! I vividly perceived before me a heap of rupees, a shawl, a plate of sweets, and two women with rings in their noses. ‘What do you want?’ I asked my mind. ‘Do you want to enjoy any of these things?’ ‘No,’ replied the mind, ‘I don’t want any of them. I don’t want anything but the Lotus Feet of God.’ I saw the inside and the outside of the women, as one sees from outside the articles in a glass room. I saw what is in them: entrails, blood, filth, worms, phlegm, and such things.”\nGirish Chandra Ghosh used to say now and then that he could cure illness by the strength of the Master’s name.\nMASTER (\nto Girish and the other devotees\n):\n“People of small intellect seek occult powers — powers to cure disease, win a lawsuit, walk on water, and such things. But the genuine devotees of God don’t want anything except His Lotus Feet. ……\n“People with a little occult power gain such things as name and fame. Many of them want to follow the profession of guru, gain people’s recognition, and make disciples and devotees. Men say of such a guru: ‘Ah! He is having a wonderful time. How many people visit him! He has many disciples and followers. His house is overflowing with furniture and other things. People give him presents. He has such power that he can feed many people if he so desires.’\n“The profession of a teacher is like that of a prostitute. It is the selling of oneself for the trifle of money, honour, and creature comforts. For such insignificant things it is not good to prostitute the body, mind, and soul, the means by which one can attain God. A man once said about a certain woman: ‘Ah! She is having a grand time now. She is so well off! She has rented a room and furnished it with a couch, a mat, pillows, and many other things. And how many people she controls! They are always visiting her.’ In other words, the woman has now become a prostitute. Therefore her happiness is unbounded. Formerly she was a maidservant in a gentleman’s house; now she is a prostitute. She has ruined herself for a mere trifle.\n“How many other visions I saw while meditating during my sadhana! Once I was meditating under the bel-tree when ‘Sin’ appeared before me and tempted me in various ways. He came to me in the form of an English soldier. He wanted to give me wealth, honour, sex pleasure, various occult powers, and such things. I began to pray to the Divine Mother. Now I am telling you something very secret. The Mother appeared. I said to Her, ‘Kill him. Mother!’ I still remember that form of the Mother, Her world-bewitching beauty. She came to me taking the form of Krishnamayi.\n3\nBut it was as if her glance moved the world.”\nSri Ramakrishna became silent. Resuming his reminiscences, he said: “How many other visions I saw! But I am not permitted to tell them. Someone one is shutting my mouth, as it were. I used to find no distinction between the sacred tulsi and the insignificant sajina leaf. The feeling of distinction was entirely destroyed. Once I was meditating under the banyan when I was shown a Mussalman\n4\nwith a long beard. He came to me with rice in an earthen plate. He fed some other Mussalmans with the rice and also gave me a few grains to eat. The Mother showed me that there exists only One, and not two. It is Satchidananda alone that has taken all these various forms; He alone has become the world and its living beings. Again, it is He who has become food.

    "translation": "Where the mind rests restrained by the practice of yoga, and where the self seeing the Self is delighted in the Self; and where established, the yogi knows that bliss which transcends the senses, which is understandable by the purified intellect only, and from the experience of Self does not even move; possessing which, he does not think any other gain greater than that; in which established he is not shaken even by great sorrow; that should be known by the term yoga, and that yoga which is free from sorrow should be attained by the undesponding and determined mind.",
    "commentary": "These four verses should be taken together The excellence of Dhyanayoga by which union with Self is attained and the Atmic state is experienced, is explained here.\nWhen the mind merges in Atma, man experiences supreme peace and bliss. That is the goal of life. But the perfectly controlled mind only can go near Atma and merge in it. The mind should be purified and withdrawn from the sense-objects. How to purify and control the mind? By the practice of yoga it should be controlled. Just as the ordinary man wastes his life in worldly pursuits (\nVishayaseva\n) – the wise man spends his life usefully in ‘\nYogaseva\n‘. So let\n`Vishayaseva’\nbe transformed into\n‘Yogaseva’,\nand let man thus attain the highest.\nBy the practice of yoga, the seeker perceives Atma. Atma is not a theoretical proposition to be comprehended by vain logic and argument. It is the Reality that can be seen (i.e.) brought into one’s own consciousness. The idea is that Atma is not like a material object which is seen with the eyes, and yet it can be known by direct experience. Seeing means experience. Nothing else can reveal the Self except the purified mind. Where is this Atma, the Lord? Atma is in one’s own self. The searchlight of the mind should be focused on one’s own heart, because Atma, the Lord, in there. He is nearest to us, nearer than anything else external or internal. We are in Him and He is in us. This idea should give us invincible strength in our sadhana. What is it that one gains by unveiling Atma in himself? He comes to possess supreme joy. Having tired himself out by seeking petty pleasures here and there, he rests himself in his own Self, and then he finds the treasure for which he has been searching everywhere.\nWhat is the nature of the joy felt in Atma? It is infinite and transcendental; it is to be comprehended by the purified intellect. When the intellect is purified, it discards its enveloping ignorance and is transformed into the Self. The bliss of the Self is experienced directly. It can never be felt by those whose minds are externalised by contact with sense-objects. How can intellect comprehend the Atmic Ananda? Though the intellect is also an organ of the mind, yet when it attains perfect purity, it discards its material form and assumes the form of Brahman. It is just like a salt-doll merging in the sea. When the salt-doll touches the sea, does it retain its former shape? No. Similarly, the intellect, when it is purified, becomes That. There is no one who does not possess the intellect. Only it is not pure. It is deluded by avidya, and many impure\n`vasanas’\ninhere in it. What the seeker has to do is wash it, clean it, and make it sharp and bright so that it can perceive the Reality as it is. The bliss of the Self is infinite (\natyanatikam\n) because it is unlike any other joy derived from worldly objects through the senses. The seeker should learn not to hanker after wretched short-lived pleasures. Having once experienced the Atmic Ananda, never again does man move away from it. True. Does the bee drinking honey from a full-blown lotus, leave it and go away to some other withered flower? When a man possesses the real thing, be it a jewel or a flower, does he hanker after its image in a photograph or a picture? If he does so, it only means that he is not in possession of the real thing. When a man thinks of dream pleasures, it only shows that he is not fully awakened from sleep.\nHaving attained the Self-state, the sage does not think of obtaining any other thing in this world or in any other. Even the position of Indra is nothing to him, not to speak of all the wealth, position, and power of this world. Worldly things are momentary, and even if they are permanent, the human body with which they are to be enjoyed is itself subject to death at any moment. Let people cultivate faith in the Lord’s teaching and stop begging for foolish pleasures which they have had through innumerable births, which are repeating themselves endlessly without their being aware of it. How many times in previous births one had wife and children? How many times was he on the crest of the wave of success, and how many times was he plunged into the depths of despair? These things have come to beings innumerable times, but they are not able to recollect them. They have been here millions of times and gone through an endless series of births and deaths. Knowing this, does any man thirst and hunger for insipid things? No. There is only one thing that man should attain, and that is the Supreme Reality.\nThe sage who has reached the plane of Atma is not moved even by the greatest disaster. We see people who are upset even by the slightest inconvenience or discomfort. There is the constant fear of losing the body, fear of poverty, fear of shame and disgrace, and a host of subtle fears which cause misery to man, however, highly placed and powerful he may be. The sage alone is free from fear because he has seen and known the imperishable Reality. Nothing can throw him off his balance. He will face the worst form of disease, dishonour, and death without the least trace of physical or mental disturbance. He is immovably established in the Self. There is no other way by which the ills and evils of life could be overcome.\nWho can attain this Self-state? It is attained by him who is undespondent and determined. The aspirant should not be deterred by any obstacle or difficulty on the spiritual path. He should have supreme self-reliance. “I will attain That, whatever may happen,” – thus should he think always. Despondency, timidity, and diffidence – these feelings should not be allowed to weaken the mind. Whatever may be the obstacles in Sadhana, the aspirant should not give up hope.\nThe power of Maya is infinite, and yet for the determined self who has obtained the grace of the Guru and the Lord nothing is impossible.\nBhagavad Gita 6.20 to 6.24 by Swami Chetanananda\nSwami Vivekananda Says —\n“Established in which state a man is not moved even by great misfortune.”\n[Source]\nSri Ramakrishna Says —\nNo sooner had M. entered the room than the Master laughed aloud and said to the boys, “There! He has come again.” They all joined in the laughter. M. bowed low before him and took a seat. Before this he had saluted the Master with folded hands, like one with an English education. But that day he learnt to fall down at his feet in orthodox Hindu fashion.\nPresently the Master explained the cause of his laughter to the devotees. He said:\n“A man once fed a peacock with a pill of opium at four o’clock in the afternoon. The next day, exactly at that time, the peacock came back. It had felt the intoxication of the drug and returned just in time to have another dose.”\n(All laugh.) M. thought this a very apt illustration. Even at home he had been unable to banish the thought of Sri Ramakrishna for a moment. His mind was constantly at Dakshineswar and he had counted the minutes until he should go again.\nIn the mean time the Master was having great fun with the boys, treating them as if they were his most intimate friends. Peals of side-splitting laughter filled the room, as if it were a mart of joy. The whole thing was a revelation to M.\nHe thought: “Didn’t I see him only yesterday intoxicated with God? Wasn’t he swimming then in the Ocean of Divine Love — a sight I had never seen before? And today the same person is behaving like an ordinary man! Wasn’t it he who scolded me on the first day of my coming here? Didn’t he admonish me, saying, ‘And you are a man of knowledge!’? Wasn’t it he who said to me that God with form is as true as God without form? Didn’t he tell me that God alone is real and all else illusory? Wasn’t it he who advised me to live in the world unattached, like a maidservant in a rich man’s house?”\nSri Ramakrishna was having great fun with the young devotees; now and then he glanced at M. He noticed that M. sat in silence. The Master said to Ramlal: “You see, he is a little advanced in years, and therefore somewhat serious. He sits quiet while the youngsters are making merry.” M. was then about twenty-eight years old.\nThe conversation drifted to Hanuman, whose picture hung on the wall in the Master’s room.\nSri Ramakrishna said:\n“Just imagine Hanuman’s state of mind. He didn’t care for money, honour, creature comforts, or anything else. He longed only for God. When he was running away with the heavenly weapon that had been secreted in the crystal pillar, Mandodari began to tempt him with various fruits so that he might come down and drop the weapon.\n1\nBut he couldn’t be tricked so easily. In reply to her persuasions he sang this song:\nAm I in need of fruit?\nI have the Fruit that makes this life\nFruitful indeed. Within my heart\nThe Tree of Rama grows,\nBearing salvation for its fruit.\nUnder the Wish-fulfilling Tree\nOf Rama do I sit at ease,\nPlucking whatever fruit I will.\nBut if you speak of fruit —\nNo beggar, I, for common fruit.\nBehold, I go,\nLeaving a bitter fruit for you.”\nAs Sri Ramakrishna was singing the song he went into samadhi. Again the half-closed eyes and motionless body that one sees in his photograph. Just a minute before, the devotees had been making merry in his company. Now all eyes were riveted on him. Thus for the second time M. saw the Master in samadhi.\nAfter a long time the Master came back to ordinary consciousness. His face lighted up with a smile, and his body relaxed; his senses began to function in a normal way. He shed tears of joy as he repeated the holy name of Rama. M. wondered whether this very saint was the person who a few minutes earlier had been behaving like a child of five.\nThe Master said to Narendra and M., “I should like to hear you speak and argue in English.” They both laughed. But they continued to talk in their mother tongue. It was impossible for M. to argue any more before the Master. Though Sri Ramakrishna insisted, they did not talk in English. (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\n—–\nSri Ramakrishna talked to the Mukherji brothers. Mahendra, the elder, had his own business. Priyanath, the younger, had been an engineer. After making some provision for himself, he had given up his job. Mahendra was thirty-five or thirty-six years old. The brothers had homes both in the country and in Calcutta.\nMASTER (\nsmiling\n):\n“Don’t sit idle simply because your spiritual consciousness has been awakened a little. Go forward. Beyond the forest of sandal-wood there are other and more valuable things — silver-mines, gold-mines, and so on.”\nPRIYA (\nsmiling\n):\n“Sir, our legs are in chains. We cannot go forward.”\nMASTER:\n“What if the legs are chained? The important thing is the mind. Bondage is of the mind, and freedom also is of the mind.\n“Listen to a story. There were two friends. One went into a house of prostitution and the other to hear a recital of the Bhagavata. ‘What a shame!’ thought the first. ‘My friend is hearing spiritual discourse, but just see what I have slipped down to!’ The second friend said to himself: ‘Shame on me! My friend is having a good time, but how stupid I am!’ After death the soul of the first was taken to Vaikuntha by the messenger of Vishnu, while that of the second was taken to the nether world of Yama.”\nPRIYA:\n“But the mind is not under my control.”\nMASTER:\n“How is that? There is such a thing as abhyasayoga, yoga through practice. Keep up the practice and you will find that your mind will follow in whatever direction you lead it. The mind is like a white cloth just returned from the laundry. It will be red if you dip it in red dye and blue if you dip it in blue. It will have whatever colour you dip it in. (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\nA person who has experienced the Atman can separate himself from body consciousness. He then watches his own body like a witness. In Varanasi, when a doctor operated on Turiyananda’s finger, the attendant asked, “Don’t you feel any pain?” The swami replied: “Look, the mind is like a child; we must hold it tight. But like a youngster it will go on crying ‘Let me go! Let me go!’ Once in the midst of surgery I let my mind get loose. Immediately I felt intense pain. The surgery was not finished. So I had to catch hold of the mind once more.” Turiyananda was silent for some time. Then he continued: “Do you know how it is? In the Bhagavad Gita we read: ‘Wherein established in the bliss of his inmost being he is not shaken even by the heaviest sorrow’ (6.22). This verse is explained by Shankara as follows, ‘A man of realization is not shaken even by the pain caused by the application of a sharp weapon.’ Two ideas are brought out here. First, Shankara shows that a perfect yogi has extraordinary control over his mind. Secondly, he shows that such a man remains in a state far beyond the control of nature.” (Source: God Lived with Them)",

(Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\nA person who has experienced the Atman can separate himself from body consciousness. He then watches his own body like a witness. In Varanasi, when a doctor operated on Turiyananda’s finger, the attendant asked, “Don’t you feel any pain?” The swami replied: “Look, the mind is like a child; we must hold it tight. But like a youngster it will go on crying ‘Let me go! Let me go!’ Once in the midst of surgery I let my mind get loose. Immediately I felt intense pain. The surgery was not finished. So I had to catch hold of the mind once more.” Turiyananda was silent for some time. Then he continued: “Do you know how it is? In the Bhagavad Gita we read: ‘Wherein established in the bliss of his inmost being he is not shaken even by the heaviest sorrow’ (6.22). This verse is explained by Shankara as follows, ‘A man of realization is not shaken even by the pain caused by the application of a sharp weapon.’ Two ideas are brought out here. First, Shankara shows that a perfect yogi has extraordinary control over his mind. Secondly, he shows that such a man remains in a state far beyond the control of nature.” (Source: God Lived with Them)",

    "translation": "Where the mind rests restrained by the practice of yoga, and where the self seeing the Self is delighted in the Self; and where established, the yogi knows that bliss which transcends the senses, which is understandable by the purified intellect only, and from the experience of Self does not even move; possessing which, he does not think any other gain greater than that; in which established he is not shaken even by great sorrow; that should be known by the term yoga, and that yoga which is free from sorrow should be attained by the undesponding and determined mind.",
    "commentary": "These four verses should be taken together The excellence of Dhyanayoga by which union with Self is attained and the Atmic state is experienced, is explained here.\nWhen the mind merges in Atma, man experiences supreme peace and bliss. That is the goal of life. But the perfectly controlled mind only can go near Atma and merge in it. The mind should be purified and withdrawn from the sense-objects. How to purify and control the mind? By the practice of yoga it should be controlled. Just as the ordinary man wastes his life in worldly pursuits (\nVishayaseva\n) – the wise man spends his life usefully in ‘\nYogaseva\n‘. So let\n`Vishayaseva’\nbe transformed into\n‘Yogaseva’,\nand let man thus attain the highest.\nBy the practice of yoga, the seeker perceives Atma. Atma is not a theoretical proposition to be comprehended by vain logic and argument. It is the Reality that can be seen (i.e.) brought into one’s own consciousness. The idea is that Atma is not like a material object which is seen with the eyes, and yet it can be known by direct experience. Seeing means experience. Nothing else can reveal the Self except the purified mind. Where is this Atma, the Lord? Atma is in one’s own self. The searchlight of the mind should be focused on one’s own heart, because Atma, the Lord, in there. He is nearest to us, nearer than anything else external or internal. We are in Him and He is in us. This idea should give us invincible strength in our sadhana. What is it that one gains by unveiling Atma in himself? He comes to possess supreme joy. Having tired himself out by seeking petty pleasures here and there, he rests himself in his own Self, and then he finds the treasure for which he has been searching everywhere.\nWhat is the nature of the joy felt in Atma? It is infinite and transcendental; it is to be comprehended by the purified intellect. When the intellect is purified, it discards its enveloping ignorance and is transformed into the Self. The bliss of the Self is experienced directly. It can never be felt by those whose minds are externalised by contact with sense-objects. How can intellect comprehend the Atmic Ananda? Though the intellect is also an organ of the mind, yet when it attains perfect purity, it discards its material form and assumes the form of Brahman. It is just like a salt-doll merging in the sea. When the salt-doll touches the sea, does it retain its former shape? No. Similarly, the intellect, when it is purified, becomes That. There is no one who does not possess the intellect. Only it is not pure. It is deluded by avidya, and many impure\n`vasanas’\ninhere in it. What the seeker has to do is wash it, clean it, and make it sharp and bright so that it can perceive the Reality as it is. The bliss of the Self is infinite (\natyanatikam\n) because it is unlike any other joy derived from worldly objects through the senses. The seeker should learn not to hanker after wretched short-lived pleasures. Having once experienced the Atmic Ananda, never again does man move away from it. True. Does the bee drinking honey from a full-blown lotus, leave it and go away to some other withered flower? When a man possesses the real thing, be it a jewel or a flower, does he hanker after its image in a photograph or a picture? If he does so, it only means that he is not in possession of the real thing. When a man thinks of dream pleasures, it only shows that he is not fully awakened from sleep.\nHaving attained the Self-state, the sage does not think of obtaining any other thing in this world or in any other. Even the position of Indra is nothing to him, not to speak of all the wealth, position, and power of this world. Worldly things are momentary, and even if they are permanent, the human body with which they are to be enjoyed is itself subject to death at any moment. Let people cultivate faith in the Lord’s teaching and stop begging for foolish pleasures which they have had through innumerable births, which are repeating themselves endlessly without their being aware of it. How many times in previous births one had wife and children? How many times was he on the crest of the wave of success, and how many times was he plunged into the depths of despair? These things have come to beings innumerable times, but they are not able to recollect them. They have been here millions of times and gone through an endless series of births and deaths. Knowing this, does any man thirst and hunger for insipid things? No. There is only one thing that man should attain, and that is the Supreme Reality.\nThe sage who has reached the plane of Atma is not moved even by the greatest disaster. We see people who are upset even by the slightest inconvenience or discomfort. There is the constant fear of losing the body, fear of poverty, fear of shame and disgrace, and a host of subtle fears which cause misery to man, however, highly placed and powerful he may be. The sage alone is free from fear because he has seen and known the imperishable Reality. Nothing can throw him off his balance. He will face the worst form of disease, dishonour, and death without the least trace of physical or mental disturbance. He is immovably established in the Self. There is no other way by which the ills and evils of life could be overcome.\nWho can attain this Self-state? It is attained by him who is undespondent and determined. The aspirant should not be deterred by any obstacle or difficulty on the spiritual path. He should have supreme self-reliance. “I will attain That, whatever may happen,” – thus should he think always. Despondency, timidity, and diffidence – these feelings should not be allowed to weaken the mind. Whatever may be the obstacles in Sadhana, the aspirant should not give up hope.\nThe power of Maya is infinite, and yet for the determined self who has obtained the grace of the Guru and the Lord nothing is impossible.\nBhagavad Gita 6.20 to 6.24 by Swami Chetanananda\nSwami Vivekananda Says —\n“Established in which state a man is not moved even by great misfortune.”\n[Source]\nSri Ramakrishna Says —\nNo sooner had M. entered the room than the Master laughed aloud and said to the boys, “There! He has come again.” They all joined in the laughter. M. bowed low before him and took a seat. Before this he had saluted the Master with folded hands, like one with an English education. But that day he learnt to fall down at his feet in orthodox Hindu fashion.\nPresently the Master explained the cause of his laughter to the devotees. He said:\n“A man once fed a peacock with a pill of opium at four o’clock in the afternoon. The next day, exactly at that time, the peacock came back. It had felt the intoxication of the drug and returned just in time to have another dose.”\n(All laugh.) M. thought this a very apt illustration. Even at home he had been unable to banish the thought of Sri Ramakrishna for a moment. His mind was constantly at Dakshineswar and he had counted the minutes until he should go again.\nIn the mean time the Master was having great fun with the boys, treating them as if they were his most intimate friends. Peals of side-splitting laughter filled the room, as if it were a mart of joy. The whole thing was a revelation to M.\nHe thought: “Didn’t I see him only yesterday intoxicated with God? Wasn’t he swimming then in the Ocean of Divine Love — a sight I had never seen before? And today the same person is behaving like an ordinary man! Wasn’t it he who scolded me on the first day of my coming here? Didn’t he admonish me, saying, ‘And you are a man of knowledge!’? Wasn’t it he who said to me that God with form is as true as God without form? Didn’t he tell me that God alone is real and all else illusory? Wasn’t it he who advised me to live in the world unattached, like a maidservant in a rich man’s house?”\nSri Ramakrishna was having great fun with the young devotees; now and then he glanced at M. He noticed that M. sat in silence. The Master said to Ramlal: “You see, he is a little advanced in years, and therefore somewhat serious. He sits quiet while the youngsters are making merry.” M. was then about twenty-eight years old.\nThe conversation drifted to Hanuman, whose picture hung on the wall in the Master’s room.\nSri Ramakrishna said:\n“Just imagine Hanuman’s state of mind. He didn’t care for money, honour, creature comforts, or anything else. He longed only for God. When he was running away with the heavenly weapon that had been secreted in the crystal pillar, Mandodari began to tempt him with various fruits so that he might come down and drop the weapon.\n1\nBut he couldn’t be tricked so easily. In reply to her persuasions he sang this song:\nAm I in need of fruit?\nI have the Fruit that makes this life\nFruitful indeed. Within my heart\nThe Tree of Rama grows,\nBearing salvation for its fruit.\nUnder the Wish-fulfilling Tree\nOf Rama do I sit at ease,\nPlucking whatever fruit I will.\nBut if you speak of fruit —\nNo beggar, I, for common fruit.\nBehold, I go,\nLeaving a bitter fruit for you.”\nAs Sri Ramakrishna was singing the song he went into samadhi. Again the half-closed eyes and motionless body that one sees in his photograph. Just a minute before, the devotees had been making merry in his company. Now all eyes were riveted on him. Thus for the second time M. saw the Master in samadhi.\nAfter a long time the Master came back to ordinary consciousness. His face lighted up with a smile, and his body relaxed; his senses began to function in a normal way. He shed tears of joy as he repeated the holy name of Rama. M. wondered whether this very saint was the person who a few minutes earlier had been behaving like a child of five.\nThe Master said to Narendra and M., “I should like to hear you speak and argue in English.” They both laughed. But they continued to talk in their mother tongue. It was impossible for M. to argue any more before the Master. Though Sri Ramakrishna insisted, they did not talk in English. (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\n—–\nSri Ramakrishna talked to the Mukherji brothers. Mahendra, the elder, had his own business. Priyanath, the younger, had been an engineer. After making some provision for himself, he had given up his job. Mahendra was thirty-five or thirty-six years old. The brothers had homes both in the country and in Calcutta.\nMASTER (\nsmiling\n):\n“Don’t sit idle simply because your spiritual consciousness has been awakened a little. Go forward. Beyond the forest of sandal-wood there are other and more valuable things — silver-mines, gold-mines, and so on.”\nPRIYA (\nsmiling\n):\n“Sir, our legs are in chains. We cannot go forward.”\nMASTER:\n“What if the legs are chained? The important thing is the mind. Bondage is of the mind, and freedom also is of the mind.\n“Listen to a story. There were two friends.

What is the source of these desires? They are born of the ego-centric will (sankalpa). So desires are described as born from Sankalpa (samkalpa prabhavah). When there is no sankalpa (thought) there is no desire. By discrimination and dispassion, it is possible to root out Sankalpa. All desires without reservation should be given up completely.\nWe have to note that whenever the Lord speaks of desires, he invariably refers to ‘all’ of them, because he knows that one desire leads to another, and that to a third, and they would extend to infinity if they are allowed to breed. So, the instruction is that all desires should be abandoned completely.\nWhen there are no desires, the mind is calm and collected and it can be made to rest in the Self.

Even here, the Lord insists on total restraint of all the senses, not partial control of all the senses or complete control of some of the senses.

They are automatically brought under control. If the mind is impure on account of past samskaras, then they draw the mind away from the spiritual path. So it is said ‘be controlled by purity of mind acquired through discrimination and dispassion’.\nThe aspirant should attain quietude by the intellect held firmly. This stillness or quietude is the effect of shutting out the external world by perfect sense-control.\nIntellect is higher than the mind (\nManastu para buddhih\n). But the intellect will be powerless to assert itself if it does not function with firmness, courage, and determination. The rebellious mind will overpower the intellect and make it dance to its tune. If the mind is like a tiger, the intellect should be like the lion. Then only the mind yields to the immovable determining will of the intellect and turns inside to see the Self.\nThe process of sense-control and mind-control should be carried on slowly and slowly (sanaih-sanaih). Force should be avoided. The mind should be turned inwards by long slow steady practice. It should be persuaded and induced to get back to back its source, from the objective world where it has wandered about for many many lives without check or control or guidance. On account of past momentum, the mind runs out in spite of one’s best effort to stop it. One may hold it by violence, but it cannot be for long. Again when the control is relaxed, it runs in its old grooves. By violent repression, the inner personality may be damaged. So persuasion is the only way.\nLet the mind be told that what it is running after is after all a mirage, that if it turns inwards it would find a nobler and higher treasure, and that its external attachments have brought only pain and suffering. Thus thinking discriminating and reasoning the mind will gradually change its former attitude. As it finds rest and peace within, it would be induced to rest in the Self longer and longer.

    "translation": "Whenever and wherever the restless and unsteady mind wanders, one should bring it back and continually focus it on God.",
    "commentary": "In the previous\nverse\n, it is said that having fixed the mind in Atma nothing else should be thought of. If the mind wanders away from the target of meditation what should be done? This question is answered here. The Gita is a practical science, and so every kind of difficulty which the seeker has to face is stated and explained, and the method pointed out to overcome it.\nThe mind is restless and unsteady. In the beginning, it is never fixed on the object of meditation. It runs away and begins to think of one thousand things of worldly life. The seeker may become despondent that he would be never able to acquire steadiness in meditation. But there is no cause for despondency. The Lord here advises the aspirant to bring back the mind again and again, and fix it in Atma. This practice should go on as long as the mind deviates from Atma. But as long as the mind is tempted by objects of enjoyment, it would naturally run after them. So, one should enlighten the mind to understand the painful nature of worldly enjoyments (\ndukhadoshanudarsanam\n). When the mind thus understands their worthlessness and painful character, it does not run after them. As the mind rests in the Self, it experiences the higher bliss of peace, and then it would not wander away from the ‘lakshya’ (Atma).\nTherefore the aspirant has to observe the activities of the mind carefully. The ignorant man identifies himself with the mind, and so he is not able to understand how the mind is misleading him in a hundred ways. The seeker gains the knowledge that the mind is betraying him, and so he looks upon its vagaries with care and caution. By observing and examining the mind, he neutralises its evil force. Desire is a form of the mind. When desires arise they should be relentlessly scrutinised and rejected. Then Atma alone shines and real peace floods the heart. So the Lord here states that the mind should be trained to rest in Atma by ceaseless practice.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda\nThe disciple was able with some difficulty to meet the Swami alone at the Belur Math to ask him some personal questions. He said: “Maharaj, I am finding it impossible to calm the mind.”\nSwami Brahmananda: “Practise a little meditation and Japa every day. Never stop for a single day. The mind is like a restless child, it wants to run away. You must bring it back again and again and apply it to the meditation on the Lord. Go on this way for two or three years, and then an inexpressible joy will fill your mind. Meditation and Japa appear dry in the beginning. But still you must engage the mind in the contemplation of the Deity, like swallowing a bitter medicine. Slowly spiritual joy will grow in you. People work so hard to pass examinations! To realize God is even easier than that. Only let them call on Him with a calm, cheerful heart.”",

    "commentary": "The Yogi who enjoys supreme bliss is described here. The happiness that one enjoys in the material world is not the highest. There is no fulness of joy in the objective world. All worldly pleasures are conditioned by time, place, and circumstances. When these change the pleasures themselves become pains. Even the joy of Indra has limitations and is subject to time. It comes and goes. The joy of Atma alone is beyond time and place and is not affected by any change of circumstances. The wise man naturally seeks the best and the highest. The Yogi who is tranquil in mind, in whom Rajasic tendencies like Kama and Krodha are brought to rest, who is free from evil, enjoys supreme joy. While all the people are running hither and thither, doing this and that, in order to secure the elusive phantom of delight and – all the time missing it – to the Yogi who lives in Brahman, joy, the best and the highest, comes of its own accord and possesses him!\nThe mind should become pure (\nakalmasham\n). If anybody opens a house which has been uninhabited for a long time, he finds in it dust, cobwebs, rats, bats, scorpions and other poisonous reptiles. The whole house should be cleaned many times, and all the undesirable occupants should be driven out before it is made fit for habitation. Even so, the mind of man, through several births, has been enveloped in darkness, and snakes of Kama and Krodha, rats of Raga and Dyesha, have found a convenient breeding place in it. Now for the first time, the awakened man has to start the work of cleansing the whole mass of evil, with all its inhabitants, prejudices, superstitions, etc. When it becomes pure, Atma, the Lord, would manifest Himself there. By peace and purity, man realise Brahman. The Jiva becomes Siva himself. The chitta (mind) when it is purified becomes Chit (Knowledge) (i.e.) it becomes one with Atma. Such a Yogi inherits his birth-right of Brahmananda.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda",

    "commentary": "Several people ask “What is the easiest way to attain Brahman ?” The Lord answers the question here. Two practices should be followed. (1) The mind should be free from evil thoughts and tendencies. (2) It should be brought to dwell in Atma by Dhyana Yoga.\nThe Lord emphasises the need for absolute purity of mind everywhere in the Gita. Atmajnana cannot dawn on an impure mind. The evil mind cannot merge in Atma. Attachment to material things is diametrically opposite to Atma which is unconditioned and uncontaminated by any other things. As the mind becomes purer and purer, it comes into contact with Brahman which is the source of the highest bliss. So purification of mind, and meditation on Atma are both mentioned here as the path to supreme joy.\nThe practice should be continued constantly (\nsada\n). That is, in whatever manner, a man may be engaged, the memory of Atma should not be slip out of the mind. Such a yogi attains Brahmasakshatkara. No worldly object however valuable it may be can help man to touch the Reality. How can a reflection touch the Reality? How can matter possess the spirit? Only the pure mind can approach Atma, and can become united with Him. In that state, one experiences indescribable bliss. It is infinite and unlike anything that is enjoyed in all the worlds. The bliss of Hiranyagarbha is also like a drop in the ocean of Brahmananda – so declare the Upanishads. Any one can attain it even in this life by following the conditions prescribed by the Lord.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda",

    "translation": "The sage harmonised in yoga sees the Self in all beings, and all beings in the Self; he sees the same everywhere.",
    "commentary": "Here the word yoga means union with Atma, the merging of the individual self in Brahman. The sage who has attained this state of yoga sees everything in his own Self, and his own Self in everything. He looks upon everything with an equal eye. Let us understand the position.\nThe whole of the objective universe is super-imposed on the basic universal consciousness – Atma or Self or Brahman. As the dream is superimposed in the consciousness of the wakeful man, as the snake is superimposed on the rope, so the entire universe is superimposed on Atma. What is superimposed cannot in reality be different from the original substance. The snake is not different from the rope. It has no separate existence.\nEven so, the seeker who has realised Brahman in himself, finds the same everywhere. This vision is possible only for the sage who has attained union with Brahman (Atma) by the practice of Dhyana Yoga, or any other ‘Yoga. The sage has discovered that he is not the body, and so instead of limiting himself to the body and seeing everything as separate fragments, he sees the all-pervading Atma in himself and in all things. Separateness comes from identification with the body. As body, one is different from everything else, and everything is different from every other thing. This separateness is born of ignorance which binds man to the body. When this ignorance is dispelled, man comes to know that he is Atma, and Atma is universal. So he finds that he as Atma is all that exists, and all that exists is himself as Atma. This vision removes all conflicts and tensions everywhere.\nThe sage is therefore full of love and compassion for all, and he takes no credit for being generous and large-hearted because love for others is only love of Self in all things. It has been taught that selfless love for others is the highest morality, the highest ethical principle. The explanation for this ethical doctrine is the spiritual concept of Self-realisation. Why do people advocate love for all? It is because there is only one Self in all. Love reveals this oneness. The Yogi knows the secret of life and the human personality. He knows that a separate existence for himself and for everyone else is only a myth and a superstition. What exists in all is Atma, and Atma alone exists. This is the basis of all morality and the explanation of all love.\nThe seeker who believes this, though he has not attained direct vision, should cultivate an equal attitude towards all beings. He should free himself from anger, envy, jealousy, and all uncharitable thoughts. He should have a large-hearted friendly feeling towards all.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda\nSwami Vivekananda Says —\nWhat is the reason that I should be moral? You cannot explain it except when you come to know the truth as given in the Gita: “He who sees everyone in himself, and himself in everyone, the sage does not injure the Self by the self.”\n[Source]\nThe first end of life is knowledge; the second end of life is happiness. Knowledge and happiness lead to freedom. But not one can attain liberty until every being (ant or dog) has liberty. Not one can be happy until all are happy. When you hurt anyone you hurt yourself, for you and your brother are one. He is indeed a yogi who sees himself in the whole universe and the whole universe in himself. Self-sacrifice, not self-assertion, is the law of the highest universe. The world is so evil because Jesus’ teaching, “Resist not evil”, has never been tried. Selflessness alone will solve the problem. Religion comes with intense self-sacrifice. Desire nothing for yourself. Do all for others. This is to live and move and have your being in God.\n[Source]\nA devotee asked Swami Saradananda, ‘Swami,\nwhy do you love us so much?\nSwami Saradananda did not say anything. After a few days when that devotee came to Udbodhan, the Swami said, ‘ A few days ago I went to Belur Math and prostrated before Sri Ramakrishna. The Master appeared before me and said, “You love all because you find me in all.” That is the answer I would give today.’” (Source:\nGod lived with Them\n, p.355)\nSri Ramakrishna Says —\nMASTER (to Ishan):\n“Please tell us the story of the boy who posted the letter.”\nISHAN (with a smile):\n“A boy once heard that God is our Creator. So he wrote a letter to God, setting forth his prayers, and posted it. The address he put on the envelope was ‘Heaven’.”\nMASTER (with a smile):\n“Did you hear that story? One succeeds in spiritual life when one develops a faith like that boy’s. (To Ishan) Tell us about the renunciation of activities.”\nISHAN:\n“After the attainment of God, religious duties such as the sandyha drop away. One day some people were sitting on the bank of the Ganges performing the sandyha. But one of them abstained from it. On being asked the reason, he said:\n‘I am observing asoucha. I cannot perform the sandyha ceremony.\n6\nIn my case the defilement is due to both a birth and a death. My mother, Ignorance, is dead, and my son, Self-Knowledge, has been born.’\n“\nMASTER:\n“Tell us, also, how caste distinctions drop away when one attains Self-Knowledge.”\nISHAN:\n“Sankaracharya was once climbing the steps after finishing his bath in the Ganges, when he saw just in front of him an untouchable who had a pack of dogs with him. ‘You have touched me!’ said Sankara. ‘Revered sir,’ said the pariah, “I have not touched you, nor have you touched me. The Self is the Inner Ruler of all beings and cannot be contaminated. Is there any difference between the sun’s reflection in wine and its reflection in the Ganges?'” (\nBG 6.29\n,\nBG 13.28\n,\nBG 13.29\n)\nMASTER (with a smile):\n“And about harmony: how one can realise God through all paths.”\nISHAN (smiling):\n“Both Hari and Hara are derived from the same root.\n7\nThe difference is only in the pratyaya.\n8\nIn reality. He who is Hari is also Hara. If a man has faith in God, then it doesn’t matter whom he worships.”\nMASTER:\n“And please tell us also how the heart of the sadhu is the greatest of all.”\nISHAN:\n“This earth is the largest thing we see anywhere around us. But larger than the earth is the ocean, and larger than the ocean is the sky. But Vishnu, the Godhead, has covered earth, sky, and the nether world with one of His feet. And that foot of Vishnu is enshrined in the sadhu’s heart. Therefore the heart of a holy man is the greatest of all.”\nThe devotees were delighted with Ishan’s words. (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\n—–\nAfter the midday meal Sri Ramakrishna rested a few minutes in his room. M. was sitting on the door. The Master was delighted to hear the music that was being played in the nahabat. He then explained to M. that Brahman alone has become the universe and all living beings.\nMASTER:\n“Referring to a certain place, someone once said to me: ‘Nobody sings the name of God there. It has no holy atmosphere.’ No sooner did he say this than I perceived that it was God alone who had become all living beings. They appeared as countless bubbles or reflections in the Ocean of Satchidananda.\n“Again, I find sometimes that living beings are like so many pills made of Indivisible Consciousness. Once I was on my way to Burdwan from Kamarpukur. At one place I ran to the meadow to see how living beings are sustained. I saw ants crawling there. It appeared to me that every place was filled with Consciousness.”\nHazra entered the room and sat on the floor.\nMASTER:\n“Again, I perceive that living beings are like different flowers with various layers of petals. They are also revealed to me as bubbles, some big, some small.”\nWhile describing in this way the vision of different divine forms, the Master went into an ecstatic state and said, “I have become! I am here!” Uttering these words he went into samadhi. His body was motionless. He remained in that state a long time and then gradually regained partial consciousness of the world. He began to laugh like a boy and pace the room. His eyes radiated bliss as if he had seen a wondrous vision. His gaze was not fixed on any particular object, and his face beamed with joy. Still pacing the room, the Master said: “I saw the paramahamsa who stayed under the banyan tree walking thus with just such a smile. Am I too in that state of mind?” (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\n—–\nHow the spiritually minded should look upon the worldly\nM. guessed that the conversation was about worldly men, who look down on those who aspire to spiritual things. The Master was talking about the great number of such people in the world, and about how to deal with them.\nMASTER (to Narendra)\n: “How do you feel about it? Worldly people say all kinds of things about the spiritually minded. But look here! When an elephant moves along the street, any number of curs and other small animals may bark and cry after it; but the elephant doesn’t even look back at them. If people speak ill of you, what will you think of them?”\nNARENDRA:\n“I shall think that dogs are barking at me.”\nGod in every being\nMASTER (smiling):\n“Oh, no! You mustn’t go that far, my child! (Laughter.)\nGod dwells in all beings. But you may be intimate only with good people; you must keep away from the evil-minded.\nGod is even in the tiger; but you cannot embrace the tiger on that account. (Laughter.) You may say, ‘Why run away from a tiger, which is also a manifestation of God?’ The answer to that is: ‘Those who tell you to run away are also manifestations of God — and why shouldn’t you listen to them?’\nParable of the “elephant God”\n“Let me tell you a story. In a forest there lived a holy man who had many disciples. One day he taught them to see God in all beings and, knowing this, to bow low before them all. A disciple went to the forest to gather wood for the sacrificial fire. Suddenly he heard an outcry: ‘Get out of the way! A mad elephant is coming!’ All but the disciple of the holy man took to their heels. He reasoned that the elephant was also God in another form. Then why should he run away from it? He stood still, bowed before the animal, and began to sing its praises. The mahut of the elephant was shouting: ‘Run away! Run away!’ But the disciple didn’t move. The animal seized him with its trunk, cast him to one side, and went on its way. Hurt and bruised, the disciple lay unconscious on the ground. Hearing what had happened, his teacher and his brother disciples came to him and carried him to the hermitage. With the help of some medicine he soon regained consciousness. Someone asked him, ‘You knew the elephant was coming — why didn’t you leave the place?’ ‘But’, he said, ‘our teacher has told us that God Himself has taken all these forms, of animals as well as men. Therefore, thinking it was only the elephant God that was coming, I didn’t run away.’ At this the teacher said: ‘Yes, my child, it is true that the elephant God was coming; but the mahut God forbade you to stay there. Since all are manifestations of God, why didn’t you trust the mahut’s words? You should have heeded the words of the mahut God.’ (Laughter.)\n“It is said in the scriptures that water is a form of God. But some water is fit to be used for worship, some water tor washing the face, and some only for washing plates or dirty linen. This last sort cannot be used for drinking or for a holy purpose. In like manner, God undoubtedly dwells in the hearts of all — holy and unholy, righteous and unrighteous; but a man should not have dealings with the unholy, the wicked, the impure. He must not be intimate with them. With some of them he may exchange words, but with others he shouldn’t go even that far. He should keep aloof from such people.”\nHow to deal with the wicked\nA DEVOTEE:\n“Sir, if a wicked man is about to do harm, or actually does so, should we keep quiet then?”\nMASTER:\n“A man living in society should make a show of tamas to protect himself from evil-minded people. But he should not harm anybody in anticipation of harm likely to be done him.\nParable of the snake\n“Listen to a story. Some cowherd boys used to tend their cows in a meadow where a terrible poisonous snake lived. Everyone was on the alert for fear of it. One day a brahmachari was going along the meadow. The boys ran to him and said; ‘Revered sir, please don’t go that way. A venomous snake lives over there.’ ‘What of it, my good children?’ said the brahmachari. ‘I am not afraid of the snake. I know some mantras.’ So saying, he continued on his way along the meadow. But the cowherd boys, being afraid, did not accompany him. In the mean time the snake moved swiftly toward him with upraised hood. As soon as it came near, he recited a mantra, and the snake lay at his feet like an earthworm. The brahmachari said: ‘Look here. Why do you go about doing harm? Come, I will give you a holy word. By repeating it you will learn to love God. Ultimately you will realise Him and so get rid of your violent nature.’ Saying this, he taught the snake a holy word and initiated him into spiritual life. The snake bowed before the teacher and said, ‘Revered sir, how shall I practise spiritual discipline?’ ‘Repeat that sacred word’, said the teacher, ‘and do no harm to anybody.’ As he was about to depart, the brahmachari said, ‘I shall see you again.’\n“Some days passed and the cowherd boys noticed that the snake would not bite. They threw stones at it. Still it showed no anger; it behaved as if it were an earthworm. One day one of the boys came close to it, caught it by the tail, and, whirling it round and round, dashed it again and again on the ground and threw it away. The snake vomited blood and became unconscious. It was stunned. It could not move. So, thinking it dead, the boys went their way.\n“Late at night the snake regained consciousness. Slowly and with great difficulty it dragged itself into its hole; its bones were broken and it could scarcely move. Many days passed. The snake became a mere skeleton covered with a skin. Now and then, at night, it would come out in search of food. For fear of the boys it would not leave its hole during the day-time. Since receiving the sacred word from the teacher, it had given up doing harm to others. It maintained its life on dirt, leaves, or the fruit that dropped from the trees.\n“About a year later the brahmachari came that way again and asked after the snake. The cowherd boys told him that it was dead. But he couldn’t believe them. He knew that the snake would not die before attaining the fruit of the holy word with which it had been initiated. He found his way to the place and, searching here and there, called it by the name he had given it. Hearing the teacher’s voice, it came out of its hole and bowed before him with great reverence. ‘How are you?’ asked the brahmachari. ‘I am well, sir’, replied the snake. ‘But’, the teacher asked, ‘why are you so thin?’ The snake replied: ‘Revered sir, you ordered me not to harm anybody. So I have been living only on leaves and fruit. Perhaps that has made me thinner.’\n“The snake had developed the quality of sattva; it could not be angry with anyone. It had totally forgotten that the cowherd boys had almost killed it.\n“The brahmachari said: ‘It can’t be mere want of food that has reduced you to this state. There must be some other reason. Think a little.’ Then the snake remembered that the boys had dashed it against the ground. It said: ‘Yes, revered sir, now I remember. The boys one day dashed me violently against the ground. They are ignorant, after all. They didn’t realise what a great change had come over my mind. How could they know I wouldn’t bite or harm anyone?’ The brahmachari exclaimed: ‘What a shame! You are such a fool! You don’t know how to protect yourself. I asked you not to bite, but I didn’t forbid you to hiss. Why didn’t you scare them by hissing?’\n“So you must hiss at wicked people. You must frighten them lest they should do you harm. But never inject your venom into them. One must not injure others. (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\nNow, it seems, an abrupt change came over the mind of Sri Ramakrishna. Tiring of the coming and going of the divine forms, and keenly feeling die need of a condition beyond the separations characteristic of relative life — the Līlā — he actually prayed to the Mother, “Give me a state where there is no separation.” For some time his mind was absorbed in what he sometimes calls the “Nitya”, sometimes the “Indivisible Satchidānanda”. He even removed from his room the pictures of gods and goddesses which hung there. In relating this the Master uses some extraordinary language. He says, “I began to meditate on the Primal Puruṣa, the Indivisible Satchidānanda, regarding myself as His handmaid.” We might puzzle over how it is possible to regard oneself as the handmaid of the Formless! But then, in a sense, He Who can be meditated upon can also be served; it was not at all uncommon for Ramakrishna to use terms like these for the Personal God without form. He lost the distinction, ultimately, between sacred and secular, and began more and more to perceive God in all beings. One morning while picking a leaf from the vilva-tree, as is done in preparing the worship, he loosened a bit of the bark. The tree appeared to him as full of Consciousness. Feeling that he had hurt the tree he was repentant. This mood came over Sri Ramakrishna frequently during the remainder of his life. Sometimes he could not pluck the sacred grass; or only with great difficulty could he cut a lemon, for example. “One day,” he told a group of devotees, “I was about to gather some flowers. They were everywhere on the trees. At once I had a vision of Virāṭ (God, seen through the vestment of the entire gross universe); it appeared that His worship was just over. The flowers looked like a bouquet placed on the head of the Deity. I could not pick them.”\nAs this mood evidently came upon him shortly before the arrival of Totāpuri, it might be called a preparation for that event. In the ensuing period Sri Ramakrishna’s consciousness was to soar ever higher, into the Absolute Itself. (Source: The Visions of Sri Ramakrishna)\nYoga-yuktātmā\nHe knows—‘They all arise in me; they all stay in me; they all disappear in me. I am the Substratum. Nothing else exists. I am the essence behind all the names and forms of the whole universe. I am the simple essence behind the cosmic magic.’ A lightning-like intuition has made him behold his own real nature. Such spontaneous recognition of one’s being is pratyabhijñā. The pratyabhijñā has arisen in him that the Self alone is real; the simple reality of ‘I AM’—Existence—alone is real. Such a one is a yoga-yuktātmā. His mind is ever aware of the Infinite. An undercurrent of this awareness of the Infinite is ever awake in him. Whether he works, meditates, sleeps, or is involved in the world, he remains in incessant samādhi.

    "commentary": "Lord Krishna is Paramatma in all, and so the Yogi of universal vision sees the Lord everywhere and everything in the Lord. When the individual self has become one with Atma, the individual and the supreme Self live together. How can one be lost to the other? Here the word ‘\npasyati\n‘ does not mean seeing with the physical eye. Seeing is experiencing the Self everywhere.\nFrom the point of view of the devotee, the Lord is Paramatma. It is explained here how the Lord’s grace works on the devotee. He who sees the Lord everywhere receives the fulness of his grace. The Lord is ever alive to the devotee, and the devotee is ever alive to the Lord.\nNo doubt all are children of the Lord. But the devotee has given up his child’s play with material things and yearns to live with the Lord. So the Lord has him ever under his loving eye and watchful care.\nOf what avail is it to spend a whole life-time seeking for the favour of some petty worldly person when the Lord Himself is ever near the individual, ready to confer the highest blessings of life? Why not approach Him? Through Jnana, equal vision and purity the Lord’s grace could be obtained in full. Having once obtained it, never is it lost again. To see the Lord in all and the Lord in all things is the aim of Yogi. This is\nSarvatmadrishti\n.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda\nSri Ramakrishna Says —\n“But for my part I accept everything: Turiya and also the three states of waking, dream, and deep sleep. I accept all three states. I accept all — Brahman and also maya, the universe, and its living beings. If I accepted less I should not get the full weight.”\nA DEVOTEE:\n“The full weight? How is that?” (\nAll laugh\n.)\nMASTER:\n“Brahman is qualified by the universe and its living beings. At the beginning, while following the method of ‘Not this, not this’, one has to eliminate the universe and its living beings. But as long as ‘I-consciousness’ remains, one cannot but feel that it is God Himself who has become everything. He alone has become the twenty-four cosmic principles.\n“When a man speaks of the essential part of the bel-fruit, he means its flesh only, and not the seeds and shell. But if he wants to speak of the total weight of the fruit, it will not do for him to weigh only the flesh. He must accept the whole thing: seeds and shell and flesh. Seeds and shell and flesh belong to one and the same fruit.\n“The Nitya and the Lila belong to the same Reality. Therefore I accept everything, the Relative as well as the Absolute. I don’t explain away the world as maya. Were I to do that I should get short weight.”\nMAHIMACHARAN:\n“It is a good synthesis: from the Absolute to the Relative, and from the Relative to the Absolute.”\nMASTER:\n“The jnanis regard everything as illusory, like a dream; but the bhaktas accept all the states. The milk flows only in dribblets from the jnani. (\nAll laugh\n.) There are some cows that pick and choose their fodder; hence their milk flows only in dribblets. But cows that don’t discriminate so much, and eat whatever they get, give milk in torrents. A superior devotee of God accepts both the Absolute and the Relative; therefore he is able to enjoy the Divine even when his mind comes down from the Absolute. Such a devotee is like the cows that give milk in torrents.” (\nAll laugh\n.)\nMAHIMA:\n“But the milk of a cow that eats without discrimination smells a little.” (\nLaughter\n.)\nMASTER (\nwith a smile\n):\n“That’s true, no doubt. Therefore that milk should be boiled. One should boil such milk over the fire a little while; there will be no smell whatever if you boil the milk over the fire of Knowledge. (\nAll laugh\n) (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\nIn his early days with Sri Ramakrishna, the young Sharat asked a blessing that he might see God in every being. The Master blessed him, saying, “Yes, you will attain it.” The following incident indicates how that blessing was fulfilled towards the end of his life: One of the devotees who was nurtured by Swami Saradananda’s loving care one day remarked, “Swami, why do you love us so much?” Swami Saradananda did not say anything. After a few days, when that devotee came to Udbodhan, the swami said: “A few days ago I went to Belur Math and prostrated before Sri Ramakrishna. The Master appeared before me and said, ‘You love all because you find me in all.’ That is the answer I would give you today.”\n(Source:\nGod Lived with Them\n)\nRamcharitmanas (Lanka Kand)\n“Siyaramamaya saba jaga jani, karahu pranama jori juga pani.”\n“Know the entire world to be pervaded by Sita and Rama; bow to it with folded hands.”\n—–\nSeeing God in everything\nis the culmination of Vedantic experience. When Nag Mahashay was asked why he remained with his hands folded reverently so much of the time, he replied, “I perceive God in every being and in everything.” (Source: They Lived with God)\nUntil one reaches the highest state of Realisation and abides in it constantly, glimpses of it come and go. But once the mind enters the infinite and limitless realm, there is no more suffering of coming and going—‘pōkku-varavu’ as Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi says. Ever splendorous, his Realisation will never dim again. The Śruti (\nChandogya Upanishad 8.4.2\n) says, “Once the dawn has arrived, and the splendorous sun of Realisation has risen, never will it set again.” (Source: Srimad Bhagavad Gita – Elixir of Eternal Wisdom)\nRelated Articles:\nIts hands and feet are everywhere; Its eyes, heads, and faces are everywhere; Its ears are everywhere; Its existence envelops all.

    "translation": "The Yogi who worships Me abiding in all beings and who is established in unity abides in me in whatever manner he is acting.",
    "commentary": "Where is God? What is the way to establish oneself in Him? These questions are answered here. God exists everywhere, in all beings of the universe. Nothing exists where He is not. Like cream in milk, like honey in flowers, like sugar in sugar cane, God is present in – everything. So knowing that God is present in all, one should not harm others. One should have friendly feeling and kindness for all beings, and do service to them. This would be the worship of the Lord.\nThe Yogi who has realised the oneness of all beings by perceiving the Lord as the inner reality, lives forever in the Lord. Just as the same Sun is reflected in a thousand different globules of water, just as the same man can play different parts in a drama by change of dress, just as the same gold exists in a hundred varieties of jewels, just as the same clay appears in pots of different shape and size, even so, the Lord exists in everything as the undifferentiated substratum. To worship Him and meditate on Him is the way to reach Him.\nThe Yogi does not always remain in meditation. There are times when he acts in the world. Will he then lose contact with the Lord? This doubt is cleared here. Though the Yogi is engaged in a hundred practical works in the world, he lives in the Lord. This is the Lord’s declaration. Like the mariner’s compass whose needle always points to the North, the mind of the Yogi is always in union with the Lord, though he is acting in the world in a variety of ways. This becomes natural to him by long practice. So he never commits the error of thinking that he is different from others, though from a physical angle of view, every being is separate from everything else. Absorption in samadhi or work in the world is the same for him because he sees the same Reality in both. This is the secret of all-mighty works performed by the perfected Yogi for the benefit of mankind. Writing good books, delivering lectures, conversing and explaining the scriptures, relieving the poor and the suffering, organising people for holy purposes, moving and acting with common humanity, the perfected yogi lives in the Lord only, and has no idea of his being a separate individual.\nIn every way:\nThe word has to be carefully understood. The Lord has not prescribed the nature of action here. But it is self-evident that wilful and sinful actions are not intended. The man who acts in evil ways is neither a Jnani nor a Bhakta. The perfected has already transcended all Tamasic and Rajasic propensities. His actions are born of sattva guna. So they are all pure and helpful, never impure and injurious. It is intended to suggest that the yogi may remain in the ecstasy of meditation or maybe actively working in the world, but in both cases, he sees and lives in the Lord.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda\nSri Ramakrishna Says —\nPrafulla finished her studies and then practised spiritual austerity for many days. Then one day Bhavani visited her; he wanted to instruct her about selfless work. He quoted to her from the\nGita\n:\n“Therefore do thou always perform obligatory actions without attachment; by performing action without attachment one attains to the highest.”\n(\nBG 3.19\n)\nHe told her the three characteristics of disinterested action: first, control of the sense-organs; second, absence of egotism; and third, surrendering the fruit of action to Sri Krishna. He further told her that no dharma is possible for the egotistic person. Quoting from the\nGita\n, he said:\n“The gunas of Prakrit; perform all action. With the understanding deluded by egotism, man thinks, I am the doer.”\n(\nBG 3.27\n)\nBhavani next spoke to her about surrendering the fruit of action to Sri Krishna. Again he quoted from the\nGita\n:\n“Whatever you do, whatever you eat, whatever you offer in sacrifice, whatever you give away, and whatever you practise in the form of austerities, Ο son of Kunti— do it as an offering to Me.”\n(\nBG 9.27\n)\nMASTER:\n“This is fine. These are the words of the\nGita\n; one cannot refute them. But something else must be noted. The author speaks about surrendering the fruit of action to Sri Krishna, but not about cultivating bhakti for Him.”\nM:\n“No, that is not especially mentioned here.\n“Next Prafulla and Bhavani talked about the use of money. Prafulla said that she offered all her wealth to Krishna.”\nM. read from the book again.\nPRAFULLA:\n“Like my actions, I offer all my wealth to Sri Krishna.”\nBHAVANI:\n“All?”\nPRAFULLA:\n“Yes, all.”\nBHAVANI:\n“In that case you won’t be able to perform action in a detached spirit. If you have to work to earn your food, you will be attached to that work. Hence there are two alternatives before you: either you will have to get your food by begging, or you will have to live on your money. Even a beggar becomes attached to the alms he receives; therefore you must use your own money to maintain your body.”\nM. (\nto the Master, smiling\n): “That is the nature of the calculating mind.”\nMASTER:\n“Yes, that is the nature of the calculating mind; that is the way the worldly man thinks. But he who seeks God plunges headlong; he doesn’t calculate about how much or how little he needs for the protection of his body.”\nM:\n“Next Bhavani asked Prafulla, ‘How will you offer all this money to Sri Krishna?’ Prafulla said: ‘Why, Sri Krishna dwells in all beings. I shall distribute the money among them.’ Bhavani answered, ‘Good! Good!’\n“Quoting from the\nGita\n, Bhavani said:\n‘He who sees Me in all things and all things in Me, never becomes separated from Me, nor do I become separated from him. That yogi who, established in unity, worships Me dwelling in all beings, abides in Me, whatever his mode of life. O Arjuna, that yogi is regarded as the highest who judges the pleasure and pain of all beings by the same standard that he applies to himself.”\n(\nBG 6.30\n,\nBG 6.31\n,\nBG 6.32\n)\nMASTER:\n“These are the characteristics of the highest bhakta.” (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\nSwami Turiyananda: “In Samadhi (absorption in God) there is complete destruction of the mind, but it must be the Nirvikalpa (absolute) Samadhi. To transcend the mind is to manifest the intellect fully. It is not that the mind is altogether annihilated, but the mind which formerly had relations with the phenomenal world is gone. Shri Ramakrishna used to say that the pure mind and the pure Self are one. The mind gets purified as soon as its worldly character is destroyed. A pure mind is that which, fully believing in the unity of Self, sees the same Atman (Self) in all, and deals with them accordingly. In the Gitâ and the Upanishads you will find that words like धीरः, आत्मवान्, प्रशान्तधीः (meaning steady and well-balanced) are repeatedly used. Such a state comes when the mind has become pure.” (Source: Spiritual Talks by the First Disciples of Sri Ramakrishna)\nRelated Articles:\nHe who, undeluded, knows Me thus as the Supreme Self— he knows all, Ο Bhārata, and he worships Me with all his heart.

    "commentary": "The practical aspect of Vedanta is emphasised here. It is in action that philosophy has to be tested and proved. It may be easily said, “All is Self, the Lord is all.” How then should he act in the world? That is the question. The sincere aspirant should be true to himself in word and deed. He should speak only that which he knows, and practise that which he speaks. So should religious spirit permeate all the words and actions of its votaries. Otherwise, their words are of no use. It is the divergence between theory and practice that brings disrepute to a person. The man who speaks religion should be exemplary in his conduct. When it is accepted that Atma is the reality in all beings, what should be the practical conduct of the yogi? How should he think, feel and act? He should intimately feel that the joys and sorrows of all beings are just the same as his own. The pangs of hunger and the bereavement of other people are of the same nature as his own. He understands the sufferings of others not only of men but of animals and other beings in the same spirit as his own suffering. He shares the gladness of others, and he suffers the pains of others. Such universality of feeling distinguishes the yogi of the highest perfection. This is religion brought into the field of practical action.\nThe Lord exhorts mankind – “Oh Ye mortals desirous of attaining me! Love others as you love yourself, feel for others as you feel for yourself. Be full of kindness and compassion, and then only are you one with Me.” Thesis like ‘All is Brahman’ (\nSarvam Khalvidam Brahma\n) has no meaning if the heart of man remains closed to the pains and pleasures of others. Man must be able to identify himself with others and partake of their joys and sorrows. The brotherhood of man taught in all religions is good. But here, the truth is enlarged to embrace all creation. The Gita and the Upanishads declare the unity of the whole universe by the presence of the Supreme Lord in everything. The teachings of the Gita have broken up all barriers not only between man and man, but also between man and all other beings. The yogi should see the same Atma everywhere. He is the best of yogis who has attained this intimate identity with every being in the universe.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda\nSwami Vivekananda Says —\nWe cannot remain without action for a moment. Act! But just as when your neighbour asks you, “Come and help me!” have you exactly the same idea when you are helping yourself? No more. Your body is of no more value than that of John.\nDon’t do anything more for your body than you do for John.\nThat is religion.\n“He whose efforts are bereft of all desire and selfishness has burnt all this bondage of action with the fire of knowledge. He is wise.”\n(\nBG 4.19\n) Reading books cannot do that. The ass can be burdened with the whole library; that does not make him learned at all. What is the use of reading many books?\n[Source]\nSwami Turiyananda: “An excellent book again is the Chandi! The philosophy of the Chandi has established the unity of Brahman and Shakti. ‘She, the Divine Mother is the Absolute and yet the relative in the form of the universe. She pervades everything. Mahâmâya (the Great Illusion) has veiled everyone with delusion that Her play may continue undisturbed. She vouchsafes both worldly enjoyment and spiritual emancipation. Such is the theme of the book. King Suratha and the merchant Samadhi worshipped the Mother for three years before they realized their desires.\n“How is it that we know, and yet cannot act? This is due to Her Mâyâ. She must be propitiated. ‘She being propitiated grants the boon of Freedom.’ Aye, without Her grace, no man can get out of this network of illusion. Only through worship can the common man realize the supreme beatitude, the state of universal consciousness. There is no other way.\n“Speak to others even as you speak to yourself. That is to say, know every one as your own self. Do you ever get angry with yourself? Even so behave with others. But that would be possible only when you see your own Self existing in others. This is the spirit which underlies Swamiji’s doctrine of the worship of the poor, the forms of Nârâyana. Indeed, there is a plane of consciousness where everything appears as one’s own Self. And when one reaches that plane, there is no more any confusion for him.” (Source: Spiritual Talks by the First Disciples of Sri Ramakrishna)\nBhagavad Gita: Chapter 6 🔻\n(47 Verses)\n01\n02\n03\n04\n05\n06\n07\n08\n09\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47",

    "commentary": "Arjuna interrupts the Lord’s discourse by submitting his own incapacity to attain the yoga which requires equanimity of mind as the condition of its practice and achievement. Evidently, Arjuna is conscious of his own inadequate power of concentration on reality. Every common human being is in the same position as Arjuna. So his question is the question of all human beings with very rare exceptions. As it is said already, Arjuna stands as a representative of the common man, though of higher culture, in his search for truth. Unsteadiness of mind is the basic problem for all seekers. If the mind is brought to a state of firmness, any yoga is practicable. Otherwise, nothing is possible. Arjuna opens his mind to the Lord and confesses his weakness without reservation. So should the disciple place before the Guru his difficulties frankly. The sick man should explain his bodily condition without reservation to the doctor. Even those secrets which he would not reveal to others should be explained to the physician. Only then can the physician prescribe the correct medicine.\nBy equality of mind:\nWe understand that Dhyanayoga demands one-pointed concentration of the entire mind in Atma. Unless the hand is steady one cannot pass the thread through the eye of the needle. Unless one sits steady and motionless, no photograph can be properly taken. So the object of concentration cannot become clear unless the roving mind comes to a standstill.\nThe word ‘\nSamyena\n‘ may also be interpreted as equality of vision (\nSarvatmadrishti\n) mentioned in the previous verse.\nBhagavad Gita 6.33 to 6.34 by Swami Chetanananda\nBhagavad Gita: Chapter 6 🔻\n(47 Verses)\n01\n02\n03\n04\n05\n06\n07\n08\n09\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47",

The body and senses are harassed continuously by its restlessness.\nPeace is practically impossible when the heart is churned by the mind like the milky ocean by the Mandara mountain.\nHaving fed and strengthened itself on worldly things for several births, it has acquired great power and defies all attempts to bring it under control. The nature of the mind is described here by four attributes. It is restless, turbulent, strong and unyielding. Every man knows the vagaries of the mind. The elders compare it to a monkey, drunk and stung by a scorpion. Those who practice meditation know how the mind rebels and defies discipline. Arjuna compares it to the wind.\nIt is strong and cannot be held or directed as one wishes.\n‘Sudushkaram’\nis the word used by Arjuna, meaning that it is very difficult to control the mind.",

    "translation": "The Lord said: Doubtless, O mighty Arjuna, the mind is restless and hard to control; but by practice and by detachment, O son of Kunti, it can be restrained.",
    "commentary": "The Lord accepts here that the task of restraining the mind is very difficult because of its restless nature. But there is no need to despair. It can be controlled by practice and dispassion. The great teachers point out that there are ways and means of overcoming the difficulties in the control of the mind. The Lord while admitting the mind’s restlessness, encourages Arjuna that there is a way to control it, and the way is practice and dispassion. One need not fear the strength of an enemy, provided he arms himself with a mightier weapon. What if the elephant is strong, it is enough if one holds the iron rod. Lions and tigers are strong, but what of it? A powerful gun is enough to overpower them. Thus the Lord wants his disciple not to become panicky and submit to the tyranny of the mind. Though difficult, it is not impossible. Is it not difficult to conquer Mount Everest? And yet man has set his foot on the snowy peak. Is it not difficult to land on the moon? And yet man stepped on the moon. The achievements of man prove that things difficult are not things impossible of attainment. So the nature of the mind, be it what it is, is not impossible to overcome.\nThis part of the Gita is of the greatest importance for all those who wish to tread the spiritual path. Enslaved by which man from time immemorial is undergoing torments of earthly existence, that which has been the cause of the endless series of births and deaths, that which stands as the mighty barrier between man and the realisation of his real Self- the mind and its conquest are explained here by the Lord. The inspiring message of the Lord should encourage every seeker to gird up his loins and pull himself together for the conquest of the apparently impossible obstacle on his way to spiritual glory.\nThe Lord answers that the mind can be controlled by 1. practice (abhyasa), and 2. dispassion(vairagya). Patanjali also expressed the same view.\nDispassion (Vairagya) means a loathful attitude to the objective world arising out of a knowledge of its short-lived, painful, and foul nature. Why should man seek illusory painful pleasures, when there is eternal Brahmananda awaiting him as his birthright? Human life is short and splits like a bubble. Why should man undergo all the ills and pains of life when perennial joy is his divine inheritance? Why should he yield to the temptations of wealth and luxury, when he knows that they are the very source of fear and suffering? All men long for peace.  All men know that peace is not to be found anywhere in the outside world and cannot be purchased by the weight of gold or height of position. Man really seeks a purer joy and higher peace.\nTo give up the lower pleasures is easy enough if the aim of the higher life is strong and convincing.\nIn the world everything causes fear, and in dispassion alone is fearlessness. When dispassion develops, the mind immediately stops thinking of the external world and it is immediately drawn into the Self. The joy of vairagya is real, unobstructed, and perennial because it is the joy of the Self, pure and uncontaminated.\nPractice (Abhyasa) is the keynote of the Lord’s message for all spiritual aspirants. The baby learns to walk by practice, the child learns to read and write by practice, the architect, the painter, the poet, the musician, the sportsman, the athlete-men of all professions acquire perfection by practice. Where the practice is less, the achievement is also less. Idleness wins nothing, and on the spiritual path idleness is the greatest enemy. All worldly gains have been acquired by hard work and constant application. The man who feels shy of labour remains where he is. Men of ordinary talents have risen in life by systematic practice in their professions of skill. That being so, is not practice necessary for attaining the highest Brahmananda? Therefore ‘practice’ says the Lord.\nDispassion aids spiritual sadhana, and practice aids to strengthen dispassion. The body and the mind function by habit. If the habits are bad, man ruins himself, if the habits are good, man saves himself. So one should practise and develop good habits. If a man is accustomed to visit a wine bar at a particular time in the day, at that exact hour, the body and mind run for the bottle and nothing can stop him. In the same way, if a man practises meditation at a particular time for a particular period, the body and mind run for it, and nothing can stop him. It is practice. When it is performed systematically and regularly, it becomes automatic, and afterward, no effort is needed to coax the mind and body to do it. As meditation becomes deeper and deeper, the joy felt at that time is so precious that man does not care to think of anything else. He is absorbed in it. So ‘practise’ says the Lord.\nArjuna is here addressed as mighty-armed (Mahabaho). Arjuna is a mighty warrior, a great hero and the Lord suggests that he should be able to control the mind without fear and despondency.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda\nSwami Vivekananda Says —\n“Only by practice and non-attachment can we conquer mind.”\n[Source]\nTo restrain the indriyas (organs) from going towards the objects of the senses, to control them and bring them under the guidance of the will, is the very central virtue in religious culture. Then comes the practice of self-restraint and self-denial. All the immense possibilities of divine realization in the soul cannot get actualized without struggle and without such practice on the part of the aspiring devotee. “The mind must always think of the Lord.” It is very hard at first to compel the mind to think of the Lord always, but with every new effort the power to do so grows stronger in us. “By practice, O son of Kunti, and by non-attachment is it attained”, says Shri Krishna in the Gita.\n[Source]",

    "translation": "Yoga is hard to attain by a man who cannot control his mind, but it can be attained by him who has controlled his mind and who strives earnestly by proper means.\nThis is My opinion.",
    "commentary": "The Lord makes it clear that without self-control union with Atma is impossible. Only the sage of controlled mind can attain the Supreme Being.\nWhoever desires the highest should control the mind by every means available to him according to his mental predisposition.\nThe mind should let go the fatal embrace in which man is held by the objective world. The bonds should be loosened. Whether it is by discrimination or devotion, by study of the sastras, by the teaching of the Guru, by personal experience, by observation of other people’s lives, in some way or other, the mind should detach itself from the kind of bondage to the external world. Only then, will it be able to turn inwards to look into its own source, the Atma, and yoga becomes possible.\nThe Lord has already declared that by practice and dispassion the mind could be controlled. Here again, by using the word ‘striving’ (\nyatata\n), he is emphasising the need for practice. The weak, the dull, the idle, the negligent can never hope to achieve anything even in worldly matters, much less in spiritual life. Sincere and steady practice is absolutely necessary. The Lord here gives another important idea – ‘skilful proceeding’ (\nUpayatah\n). One should be clever and skillful in dealing with the mind. The mere dry disciple may not yield good results. Firmness may not always succeed, and so skill becomes necessary in dealing with a powerful enemy. One should be a good strategist in spiritual life also. The great commanders advance or withdraw their forces for strategical reasons, and gain ultimate victory. So one should deal with the mind as a deadly foe who should be conquered by firm action or by force or skill.\nThe seeker should have only one aim and that is to understand the peculiar propensity of his own mind and get it to a state of restfulness in whatever way he considers best.\nLet people have faith in the words of the Lord. Let there be no doubt about the success in the attempt, as the Lord is with the aspirant in this holy attempt. By His Grace, discrimination and dispassion will certainly be attained by the Sadhaka and self-realisation will be rendered possible for every seeker even in this life.\nSri Ramakrishna Says —\nA MARWARI DEVOTEE:\n“Sir, what is the way?”\nMASTER:\n“There are two ways. One is the path of discrimination, the other is that of love. Discrimination means to know the distinction between the Real and the unreal. God alone is the real and permanent Substance; all else is illusory and impermanent. The magician alone is real; his magic is illusory. This is discrimination.\n“Discrimination and renunciation. Discrimination means to know the distinction between the Real and the unreal. Renunciation means to have dispassion for the things of the world. One cannot acquire them all of a sudden. They must be practised every day. One should renounce ‘woman and gold’ mentally at first. Then, by the will of God, one can renounce it both mentally and outwardly. It is impossible to ask the people of Calcutta to renounce all for the sake of God. One has to tell them to renounce mentally.\n“Through the discipline of constant practice one is able to give up attachment to ‘woman and gold’. That is what the Gita says. By practice one acquires uncommon power of mind. Then one doesn’t find it difficult to subdue the sense-organs and to bring anger, lust, and the like under control. Such a man behaves like a tortoise, which, once it has tucked in its limbs, never puts them out. You cannot make the tortoise put its limbs out again, though you chop it to pieces with an axe.”\n(See also:\nBG 2.58\n,\nBG 6.35\n)\nMARWARI DEVOTEE:\n“Revered sir, you just mentioned two paths. What is the other path?”\nMASTER:\n“The path of bhakti, or zealous love of God. Weep for God in solitude, with a restless soul, and ask Him to reveal Himself to you.\nCry to your Mother Syama with a real cry, O mind!\nAnd how can She hold Herself from you?”\nMARWARI DEVOTEE:\n“Sir, what is the meaning of the worship of the Personal God? And what is the meaning of God without form or attribute?”\nMASTER:\n“As you recall your father by his photograph, so likewise the worship of the image reveals in a flash the nature of Reality.\n“Do you know what God with form is like? Like bubbles rising on an expanse of water, various divine forms are seen to rise out of the Great Akasa of Consciousness. The Incarnation of God is one of these forms. The Primal Energy sports, as it were, through the activities of a Divine Incarnation.\n…..\n“One ultimately discovers God by trying to know who this ‘I’ is. Is this ‘I’ the flesh, the bones, the blood, or the marrow? Is it the mind or the buddhi? Analysing thus, you realise at last that you are none of these. This is called the process of ‘Neti, neti’, ‘Not this, not this’. One can neither comprehend nor touch the Atman. It is without qualities or attributes.\n“But, according to the path of devotion, God has attributes. To a devotee Krishna is Spirit, His Abode is Spirit, and everything about Him is Spirit.”",

That is the Lord’s promise to all seekers. It is like a life-giving elixir to all people who are doing good in some form or other. People may doubt whether any good comes to them by being and doing good. In fact, to the ignorant, the world presents the curious spectacle of bad people enjoying more material comforts than the good and the righteous. But a closer look into the facts of life shows that the wicked and the evil-minded are daily undergoing destruction in their own heart of hearts, and they shall be hurled into lower and lower planes of existence. The good live and thrive in the sun-shine of God’s grace, though material riches they may not possess. They need to have no doubt about their present or future because the Lord here declares that they will never come to a bad state. Let this promise of the Lord be remembered, whenever doubt or fear enters one’s heart.\n“Do good, your future is assured.” This is the Lord’s call to all seekers. Though Arjuna’s question pertains to the votaries of Dhyanayoga, Lord gives a general answer which embraces all those who are working on the spiritual path in different ways. So the general term (\nKalyana krit\n) (Who does good) is used. It is implied that the evil-doers shall suffer a terrible doom here and hereafter. So let nobody indulge in sinful activities. The Lord gives the hope that whatever is left undone by the seeker shall be completed by him in later life to come.\nThe Lord addresses his disciple in the most endearing terms as ‘O my son’ (\nTata\n). The Lord has a paternal attitude towards all\nsadhakas\n, and will always take care of them here and here-after. The love and compassion of the Lord for the devotee is revealed here.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda\nSwami Vivekananda Says —\n[The following paragraph is a reminiscence by Swami Vivekananda’s disciple Sharat Chandra Chakravarty.]\nAt the time Belur Math was established, many among the orthodox Hindus were wont to make sharp criticism of the ways of life in the Math. Hearing the report of such criticism from the disciple, Swamiji would say (in the words of the couplet of Tulasidas), “The elephant passes in the market-place, and a thousand curs begin barking after him; so the sadhus have no ill-feeling when worldly people slander them.” Or again he would say, “Without persecution no beneficent idea can enter into the heart of a society.” He would exhort everybody, “Go on working without an eye to results. One day you are sure to reap the fruits of it.” Again, on the lips of Swamiji were very often heard the words of the Gita, “A doer of good never comes to grief, my son.”\n[Source]\nIn reference to me every now and then attacks are made in missionary papers (so I hear), but I never care to see them. If you send any of those made in India, I should throw them into the wastepaper basket. A little agitation was necessary for our work. We have had enough. Pay no more attention to what people say about me, whether good or bad. You go on with your work and remember that “Never one meets with evil who tries to do good.”\n[Source]",

    "translation": "The man who has fallen away from yoga goes to the worlds of the righteous. Having lived there for unnumbered years, he is reborn in the home of the pure and the prosperous.",
    "commentary": "The Lord traces the life-course of sadhakas who die without attaining perfection in yoga. They go to the worlds of the good, live there for many years, and then take birth in a pure and prosperous home. They take up the thread of sadhana that was snapped by death in the middle. They enjoy life in the highest worlds, and when they come to the earth again, they are prosperous. Let it not be misunderstood that they revel in gold and destroy themselves by abusing their wealth. The Lord states ‘\nSuchinam\n‘ (of the pure) first, and next ‘\nSrimatam\n‘ (of the wealthy). Purity first and prosperity next. They do not suffer the pains of poverty and at the same time, their home is full of sanctity and purity. Such a spiritual home, free from the torments of poverty, is most congenial for sadhana. If he is poor he has to fritter away part of his life and energy for seeking out his livelihood. If he is wealthy, he may lose himself in material pleasures. Pure and prosperous homes provide the best training ground for spiritual practice. If however, one is asked to choose between the two, he has to choose the pure in preference to the wealthy.\nThe theory of re-incarnation (\nPunarjanma\n) has already been stated in the\nSecond Discourse\n. Verses like\n‘\nDehino\nsmin yathadehe\n‘ etc., and here ‘\nPrapya punyakritam lokan\n‘ etc. prove that there is a continuity in the life of man from birth to birth.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda\nSri Ramakrishna Says —\nAddressing Mr. Mukherji, Sri Ramakrishna said: “You are rich, and still you call on God. That is very good indeed.\nIt is said in the\nGita\nthat those who fall from the path of yoga are born in their next birth as devotees of God in rich families.\n“\nMr. Mukherji. quoted the line from the\nGita\n.\nMASTER:\n“God, if He so desires, can keep a jnani in the world too. The world and all living beings have been created by His will. But He is self-willed.”\nMUKHERJI (\nwith a smile\n):\n“How can God have any will? Does He lack anything?”\nMASTER (\nwith a smile\n):\n“What’s wrong in that? Water is water whether it is still or in waves. The snake is a snake whether it is coiled up motionless or wriggles along. A man is the same man whether sitting still or engaged in action. (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)",

Such a birth, says the Lord is very difficult to attain because they are men of knowledge having reached the Atmic state, and being born as children of the wise provides the best opportunity for self-realisation.\nWe find that mighty spiritual men were born to parents who had done a great ‘\ntapas\n‘.\nThe atmosphere in such homes is saturated with divine fragrance. They breathe the atmosphere and feel the very presence of God. What more does the aspirant require to complete his yoga and attain perfection?\nPeople wish to be born in the lineage of kings, princes, and millionaires. Of what avail is it except to get further entangled in the meshes of Maya, and suffer the inevitable penalties of earthly life? The wise man desires to be born in the line of yogis so that he could attain perfection in the shortest possible time.

    "translation": "There he comes in touch with the knowledge acquired in his former body, O son of the Kurus, and strives still further for perfection.",
    "commentary": "The theory of reincarnation is explained in greater detail here. Though the body is dead and gone, yet the mind, with all the impressions acquired in previous births, live on, and when the Jiva takes another body, the former mental endowment comes to him. So he continues the sadhana exactly from the point where it came to an end when the body fell. Nothing is lost in death except the fleshy tabernacle. There is a continuity from birth to birth, and the chain continues till the moment when liberation is attained, and the mind with all its samskaras is destroyed. This view of rebirth is the only possible explanation for the disparity in the mental make-up of different individuals as we see them. The good thoughts, feelings, and actions of the past create a natural propensity for good things in this life. Even so, the bad thoughts and deeds done in the past produce a natural inclination to evil in this life. So, it is a warning to all to be careful of what force they are generating at the present moment. They should realise that they are accumulating samskaras and giving a special direction to their future life by their thoughts and actions at the present moment. Let no one complain that he is bad because society or circumstances made him bad. He has himself created the bad in and around him, and he should shoulder full responsibility for what he is in the present birth. He is the maker of his own destiny. He reaps what he sows.\nFrom this, we understand that good and bad, knowledge and ignorance follow every being like his shadow from birth to birth. When the entire karma is destroyed in the fire of Jnana, then there is no more any shadow because there is no more any separate individual as such. So even before the body falls, man should enlighten his intellect and give it perfect knowledge. By several kinds of spiritual practices, he should instill divine tendencies. Those alone follow man after death. All other things, the dearest and the most precious are left behind. The wise man should therefore purify the subtle body and instill divine flavour and knowledge. As nothing that is done goes to waste, the little japa, tapas, knowledge. Dana and Dharma, will bear fruit in the next life and make the spiritual journey easier and quicker.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda\nSwami Vivekananda Says —\nBut though it is so hard to reach the goal, yet even our smallest attempts are not in vain. We know that nothing is lost. In the Gita, Arjuna asks Krishna (*), “Those who fail in attaining perfection in yoga in this life, are they destroyed like the clouds of summer?” Krishna replies, “Nothing, my friend, is lost in this world. Whatever one does, that remains as one’s own, and if the fruition of yoga does not come in this life, one takes it up again in the next birth.” Otherwise, how do you explain the marvellous childhood of Jesus, Buddha, Shankara?\n[Source]\nSri Ramakrishna Says —\nM:\n“God’s power is in you. That is why there is such power of attraction. It is the Divine Spirit that attracts.”\nMASTER:\n“Yes, this is the attraction of Yogamaya, the Divine Sakti. She casts the spell. God performs all His lila through the help of Yogamaya.\n28.2 Nature of gopis’ love for Krishna\n“The love of the gopis was like the attachment of a woman to her paramour. They were intoxicated with ecstatic love for Sri Krishna. A woman cherishing illicit love is not very keen about her own husband. If she is told that her husband has come, she will say: ‘What if he has? There is food in the kitchen. He can help himself.’ But if she is told of the arrival of a stranger — jovial, handsome, and witty — she will run to see him and peep at him from behind a screen.\n“You may raise an objection and say: ‘We have not seen God. How can we feel attracted to Him as the gopis felt attracted to Krishna?’ But it is possible. ‘I do not know Him. I have only heard His name, and that has fixed my mind upon Him.'”\nA DEVOTEE:\n“Sir, what is the significance of Sri Krishna’s stealing the gopis’ clothes?”\nMASTER:\n“There are eight fetters that bind a person to the world. The gopis were free from all but one: shame. Therefore Krishna freed them from that one, too, by taking away their clothes. On attaining God one gets rid of all fetters. (\nTo Mahendra Mukherji and the others\n)\nBy no means all people feel attracted to God. There are special souls who feel so. To love God one must be born with good tendencies. Otherwise, why should you alone of all the people of Baghbazar come here?\nYou can’t expect anything good in a dunghill. The touch of the Malaya breeze turns all trees into sandal-wood, no doubt. But there are a few exceptions — the banyan, the cotton-tree, and the aswattha, for example.\n(\nTo the Mukherji brothers\n) “You are well off. If a man slips from the path of yoga, then he is reborn in a prosperous family and starts again his spiritual practice for the realisation of God.”\nMAHENDRA:\n“Why does one slip from the path of yoga?”\nMASTER:\n“While thinking of God the aspirant may feel a craving for material enjoyment. It is this craving that makes him slip from the path. In his next life he will be born with the spiritual tendencies that he failed to translate into action in his present life.”\nMAHENDRA:\n“Then what is the way?”\nMASTER:\n“No salvation is possible for a man as long as he has desire, as long as he hankers for worldly things. Therefore fulfil all your desires regarding food, clothes, and sex. (\nSmiling\n) What do you say about the last one? Legitimate or illegitimate? (\nM. and Mahendra laugh\n.) (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\nOn one occasion Sri Ramakrishna asked\nPurna\n, “What do you think of me?” Filled with devotion, Purna replied without hesitation, “You are God Himself, come to earth in flesh and blood.”\nOn 15 July 1885, Balaram asked the Master, “Sir, how was it possible for Purna to know all of a sudden that the world is illusory?” Sri Ramakrishna replied: “He has inherited that knowledge from his previous births. In his past lives he practised many disciplines. It is the body alone that is small or grows big, and not the Atman.”",

    "translation": "Indeed, they feel drawn toward God, even against their will, on the strength of their past discipline. Such seekers naturally rise above the ritualistic principles of the scriptures.",
    "commentary": "From this, we understand the force of samskaras acquired in previous births. Even without any volition on his part, he is drawn to yoga. This is due to the mysterious power of nature acting through past experience. As the fish takes to water, as the bird takes to the air, he, the\nyogabhrashta\ntakes to yoga. Past thoughts and habits of life, whatever they may be, fulfill themselves in the present birth. We come across persons who are born with vairagya, whom no temptations can draw down into the mire of samsara. Just so, we find persons steeped in samsara in spite of all the disasters and calamities of life. So, past yogic practice drives him who are born to take to yoga without his being aware of any special effort on his part. He cannot remain idle. It is the duty of all seekers to do as much spiritual sadhana as they can so that when he takes a new birth he can rise to higher and higher planes of Self-realisation.\nThe second line of the verse reveals the transcendental power of yoga (union with Self). Even by thinking of the law of yoga, he transcends all the Vedic lore and sastric leaning, and directly rises to the supreme state. Here ‘\nSabdabrahma\n‘ may mean either the fruits of Vedic rites and rituals or indirect knowledge arising from the study of the sastras. From this, we understand the power of yoga which leads to union with Brahman. If by merely thinking of yoga he can transcend the lower level, what reward he would get by actual practice can be imagined.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda\nIt was nine o’clock in the evening. The doctor had been sitting there since six o’clock, watching all these things.\nGIRISH (\nto the doctor\n): “Well, sir, does it ever happen to you that, though you do not intend to come here, you are drawn as if by a subtle force? I feel that way; that is why I am asking you.”\nDOCTOR: “I don’t know whether I feel that. But the heart alone knows the promptings of the heart. (\nTo Sri Ramakrishna\n) Besides, there isn’t much use in speaking about it.” (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)",

    "commentary": "The yogi reaches the highest state by assiduous practice through several births. Three factors are mentioned here – 1. Assiduous striving, 2. Continued practice 3. Purity.\nThe weak and the cowards cannot reach the goal. “The weak cannot realise Atma. The heroic man realises the Supreme self”-Thus the Upanishads declare that strength and courage are essential for spiritual realisation.\nIf the yogi acquires such strength, courage, and perseverance in yoga, it is the result of continued practice through several births. Birth as man, desire for liberation, are the reward of good work done in the past. It does not mean that one has to wait for a long series of births to attain freedom. No. It can be achieved even in this birth, nay even in this hour, if the will is strong and the effort adequate. When the Lord speaks of several births, it is only to emphasise that the good work done in the past never goes to waste. He does not want the man to postpone the glorious consummation even by a second. Since no one knows what he has done in the past, let him have faith that the best would bear fruit now and take him to the highest state.\nPurity of mind has been mentioned as essential for Self-realisation in many places in the Gita. By Nishkama Karma, devotion, discrimination, and knowledge, man should purify his inner self, before he could experience any spiritual enlightenment.\nSupreme State:\nMoksha is the highest state. There is nothing higher than that because it is the state of absolute freedom. All other states are conditioned by time, place and other limiting adjuncts. Moksha is beyond all relative values. The law of causation which binds everything is transcended by the yogi when he reaches the highest state. Freedom is the birth-right of man, the one urge promoting him in all that he does, though he is not conscious of it. Yoga is the direct path to freedom.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda\nSwami Vivekananda Says —\nJust take your own case — do you think it is possible without the grace of God to have the blessed company of Nag Mahashaya, a man who rose to spiritual perfection through the strength of divine grace and came to know fully what this grace really means? “One attains the highest stage after being perfected by the practice of repeated births.” It is only by virtue of great religious merit acquired through many births that one comes across a great soul like him. All the characteristics of the highest type of bhakti, spoken of in the scriptures, have manifested themselves in Nag Mahashaya. It is only in him that we actually see fulfilled the widely quoted text, तृणादपि सुनीचेन. (*) Blessed indeed is your East Bengal to have been hallowed by the touch of Nag Mahashaya’s feet!\n[Source]",

    "translation": "O Arjuna! The yogi is thought to be greater than the ascetic, greater than the learned, and greater than the man of action; therefore be a yogi.",
    "commentary": "The superiority of Dhyana yoga is declared here. It is superior to ascetic practices mentioned in the Vedas like fasting etc. It is superior to knowledge acquired from the study of sastras. It is superior to works mentioned in Vedic Karmakanda, like the worship of the sacred Fire etc. That is, meditation on Atma is superior to knowledge acquired through the study of the sastras. The knowledge attained in Dhyana is direct and conclusive since the aim of spiritual sadhana is Self-realisation. Whatever brings the aspirant directly into contact with Atma, and lifts him to that plane, should be considered superior. Dhyana has that power of taking the yogi nearer and nearer to Atma.\nBe thou a yogi:\nThis is the Lord’s command to Arjuna. Having explained the process and excellence of yoga, the Lord commands his disciple to train himself as a yogi. The convincing arguments behind the command show how the Gita follows the rational path of judging first and decision next. Everything is examined on its own merits, and conclusions are drawn after a thorough understanding of the subject. So it is not blind faith that the Lord is expecting from his disciple. It is faith born of knowledge, judgment, and decision. The command applies to all people who are awakened from the delusion of life, and who are eager to overcome the infinite ills of life by knowing the truth. ‘Yoga’ and ‘Bhoga’ are both open to man. The one who chooses the first rise to the supreme state. The one who chooses the latter gets stuck up in the bog of samsara. Therefore one should strive to be a yogi and not a bhogi. He is not a yogi who merely puts on the ochre robes. He is a yogi who has withdrawn his mind from sense-pleasures, who keeps the senses under control, who looks inwards into the Self, and there comes to rest in peace. All human beings are qualified for this noble and grand aim.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda",

    "commentary": "In the previous\nverse\n, the superiority of the yogi to the ascetics, the learned men, and men of Vedic works is declared. In this verse, the Lord states that the yogi who worships Him, the Absolute, with faith, is the greatest of all yogis. Lord Krishna is himself the supreme in-dwelling Self of all, and so when the Lord says “Worship Me,” it is taken to mean “be united with Me, the Self, the Absolute.” Or from the point of view of the devotee (Bhakta), the Lord as the divine form of Krishna may be taken as the object of worship. In any way, the yogi who worships the Lord, the Absolute, is greater than those who worship the Devas.\nThe purpose of all sadhana is to free the mind from impure tendencies binding it to the material world. In this process, devotion to the Lord is of primary importance. It is the Lord’s grace that leads man to success in any yoga – Karma yoga, Jnana yoga or Dhyana yoga. That seed which is watered sprouts into life and grows. Devotion to God is the water that soaks the mind of the aspirant and bears fruit in the ultimate success of all his endeavours.\nIs the conquest of Maya an easy task? What is man before the power of Maya? With weak and troubled mind filled with all the filth of sensual pleasures, how can man hope to conquer Maya? Can he hope to do so by his own efforts? He cannot, except with the support of the Lord. The worship of the Lord is the only guarantee of success in any yoga.\nTherefore, all great spiritual giants who come to teach mankind have taken refuge in Him and have worked as His instruments. It is to be noted that whatever the subject of the particular Discourse, the Lord does make a reference to devotion, to remind the seeker to have faith in Him and perform his work.\nDevotion thus forms the final note in this Discourse on Dhyana Yoga.\nGod, the Absolute, should be worshipped with faith. The Gita emphasises faith in many places. What is done without faith does not bear fruit. It is as good as not having done anything at all. Along with ‘Sama’ and ‘Dama’, Sraddha (faith) is the chief ingredient in spiritual practice.\nThe mind should be merged in Him. Possessing faith, the seeker should turn the mind inwards and become united with the Absolute. Such a yogi is most devout (\nYukta tamah\n).\nThe Lord declares that this is His doctrine. From this, we can understand the importance of faith and devotion to Him, as the foundation of all Yogas.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda",
