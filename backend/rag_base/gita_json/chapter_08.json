    "translation": "The Lord said: Brahman is supreme, imperishable. Its essential nature is called Adhyatma (Self-knowledge); the act of sacrifice that causes the birth of beings is named karma (action).",
    "commentary": "Three questions are answered in this verse. First,\nwhat is Brahman?\nThe Supreme and the imperishable is Brahman. Two attributes are mentioned here – supreme (\nParamam\n) and imperishable (\nAksharam\n). There is nothing other than or superior to Brahman. The One above and beyond which there is nothing else is Brahman. That is why it is described to be supreme Paramam. Brahman is imperishable, deathless. Since it is deathless it cannot be said to be born. The whole universe is constantly changing and going through the process of creation and dissolution in an endless chain. Birth and death is the law of nature, and there is only One that is birthless and deathless and that is Brahman. It is the seer (Drik), and so is indestructible. Destruction is only spoken of the seen (Drisya), and not of the seer (Drik). Brahman is indivisible, unaffected by time, space and causation.\nTo the second question – ‘\nWhat is Adhyatma?\n‘- the answer given is nature (svabhava). One’s nature is svabhava (i.e.) the real Self of man, distinct from the superimposed body, mind, and senses. Out of ignorance, man thinks that he is the body and the mind, and that is his reall nature. It is an error. When knowledge dawns, one knows that he is the Self, Atma, uncontaminated by the body, mind, and the senses. So long as man identifies himself with the elements, which are subject to change and death, he cannot be happy. True happiness is only in the Self, pure, perfect, and imperishable.\nThe third question is\n‘What is Karma?’\nThe answer is ‘an act of sacrifice’, which is the cause of the birth of beings. This is yajna. By yajna, rains are produced and from rains, food, and from food all beings are born. The word ‘\nVisarga\n‘ here means that which is given away or that which is offered as a sacrifice to the Gods in the sacred Fire of the Yajna. In charity (Dana), wealth is sacrificed. Service to mankind in any form is an act of sacrifice. This also is Yajna, and it leads to Moksha.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda",

    "translation": "For whatever object a man thinks of at the final moment, when he leaves his body— that alone does he attain, Ο son of Kunti, being ever absorbed in the thought thereof.",
    "commentary": "Whatever a man thinks and contemplates frequently, becomes a tendency which holds the mind enslaved by ill-power and momentum. So it is said that whatever form or object the dying man thinks, he will obtain when he takes a new birth. Jadabharata in spite of his great tapas was attached to a fawn which he protected and when he passed away, the thought of the fawn filled his mind. Consequently, he was born as a deer. As one thinks so he becomes (\nYadbhavam tadbhavati\n). This being the law, every thoughtful man should be extremely careful to choose and select only noble and spiritual thoughts to fill the mind. This should be practised throughout one’s life, so that they should be uppermost in the mind at the time of death. As all other things in the world are pain-causing, sorrow-breeding, the wise man naturally thinks of the Blessed Lord as the be-all and end-all of his life. Thus man attains the supreme state. Devotion, Dhyana, study, company of the wise, charity, all these should be practised truthfully and by so doing, divine thoughts permeate the mind and determine the future birth of man.\nThat is why spirited sadhana is prescribed from childhood when the mind is pure and free from the poisonous ugliness of worldly life. Every man is himself responsible for his freedom or bondage. “If one thinks that he is free, free he is this moment. If he thinks he is bound, bound he should be.” Either high birth or low birth or freedom from birth and death, all these depend on man’s mental frame. And this frame of mind is forged by long practice throughout life. The good samskaras would re-assert themselves in the next birth and lead him to the goal.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda\nSwami Vivekananda Says —\nWhen a yogi makes a samyama (*) on his own karma, upon those impressions in his mind which are now working, and those which are just waiting to work, he knows exactly by those that are waiting when his body will fall. He knows when he will die, at what hour, even at what minute. The Hindus think very much of that knowledge or consciousness of the nearness of death, because it is taught in the Gita that the thoughts at the moment of departure are great powers in determining the next life.\n[Source]\nSri Ramakrishna Says —\n“Man becomes pure by repeating the name of God. Therefore one should practise the chanting of God’s name. I said to\nJadu Mallick\n‘s mother: ‘In the hour of death you will think only of worldly things—of family, children, executing the will, and so forth. The thought of God will not come to your mind. The way to remember God in the hour of death is to practise, now, the repetition of His name and the chanting of His glories. If one keeps up this practice, then in the hour of death one will repeat the name of God. When the cat pounces upon the bird, the bird only squawks and does not say, ‘Rama, Rama, Hare-Krishna’.\n“It is good to prepare for death. One should constantly think of God and chant His name in solitude during the last years of one’s life. If the elephant is put into the stable after its bath it is not soiled again by dirt and dust.” (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\n—–\nVAISHNAVA:\n“Sir, is a man born again?”\nMASTER:\n“It is said in the\nGita\nthat a man is reborn with those tendencies that are in his mind at the time of his death. King Bharata thought of his deer at the time of death and was reborn as a deer.” (\nBG 8.5\n,\nBG 8.6\n)\nVAISHNAVA:\n“I could believe in rebirth only if an eye-witness told me about it.”\nMASTER:\n“I don’t know about that, my dear sir. I cannot cure my own illness, and you ask me to tell you what happens after death!\n“What you are talking about only shows your petty mind. Try to cultivate love of God. You are born as a human being only to attain divine love. You have come to the orchard to eat mangoes: what need is there of knowing how many thousands of branches and millions of leaves there are in the orchard? To bother about what happens after death! How silly!”\n(\nBG 8.7\n,\nBG 8.8\n) (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\nAll this is Brahman. Everything comes from Brahman, everything goes back to Brahman, and everything is sustained by Brahman. One should therefore quietly meditate on Brahman. Each person has a mind of his own. What a person wills in his present life, he becomes when he leaves this world. One should bear this in mind and meditate accordingly.\n—\nChandogya Upanishad 3.14.1",

    "translation": "Engaged in the yoga of constant practice and not allowing the mind to wander away to anything else, he who meditates on the supreme, resplendent Purusha reaches Him, Ο son of Prithā.",
    "commentary": "In this verse, three definite practices are mentioned to reach the Supreme Lord.\nThe practice of yoga.\nThe mind should not swerve from the Lord, as the supreme goal.\nOne should meditate on the Lord continuously.\n1. The Lord has elevated ‘practice’ (\nabhyasa\n) to the state of the yoga, like Karma yoga, Jnana yoga etc.\nNo other yoga can bear fruit without being supported by\nabhysa\nyoga.\nIn the\n6th Discourse\n, the Lord has already referred to practice (‘Abhyasa’) as the primary method of controlling the mind.\nIn the practical field of work, we understand the need for systematic practice. In sport and art, practice is essential for perfection. In fact, practice is nothing else than the repetition of the mode of thought or act. Any act repeated many times becomes a habit. All the bad habits have been the accumulated effect of wrong practice. If practice is done in the right direction, good thoughts and acts become natural and spontaneous. When one comes across a person who is pure in thought, word and deed, he admires him, and sometimes wonders how he could be so pure. But he should realise how he had laid the foundations of purity by long abhyasa yoga. All the impurities and weaknesses arising from previous births are overcome by the steadfast practice of goodness and purity in this life. Whatever may be the yoga that the seeker chooses to follow, it should be first and last combined with abhyasa yoga. Then alone it would yield good results, just as purifying powders work on the human body only when they are mixed with water.\n2. The second thing is that the man should not move away from the ideal. The aim is Atma, and the mind should therefore be centered in the Atma, and not allowed to move out towards material objects. Whatever appears (‘anatma’) perishes. Knowing this, through discrimination one should hold fast to Atma alone. As the mind by its nature can only hold on to some form it should be given some divine object or form to which it can easily cling to. So it is said here that one should meditate on the Supreme Divine Lord (\nParamam Purusham Divyam\n).",

    "commentary": "The Lord says that he would declare the Supreme briefly. The Supreme has no end as no words can fully describe it, so the Lord gives the very essence of the Vedas and the worship of the Supreme as the simple single syllable OM-Pranava.\nThe Vedas declare that Brahman alone is Eternal. Everything else is transitory and changing. It is this Reality that man has to understand and realise. Knowledge of all other things cannot confer the bliss of immortality. In Hinduism, every child when he starts his education begins with the sacred word OM, which is Brahman. So whatever else a man may learn and understand, he should not neglect the knowledge of the Imperishable Brahman. The knowers of Vedas, after a great deal of thought, have arrived at the highest goal Brahman, and thus attained absolute peace and bliss.\nWho can enter this state? This question is also answered here. Only those who are free from attachment and desire, free from lust and hatred, can enter the Brahmi State. Let no man complain that he cannot attain that state. The key to this consummation is in his hands. It is purity. Let the mind be purged of all impure tendencies, and that very moment Brahman is realised.\nThose who practise severe austerities, restraining the senses and controlling the mind are qualified and fit to realise Brahman.\nCelibacy is the bedrock for all spiritual development. Those who aspire for the highest should be free from sensuality in thought, word and deed. They should live and move in Brahman, the pure and blessed untainted by anything else.\nThe Lord uses the emphatic term ‘Pravakshye’ to indicate the importance of Brahma-Vidya which he teaches to His disciple and through him to all mankind.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda",

    "commentary": "The process of meditating on OM and attaining final liberation is explained here. It does not mean that one should follow it only at the time of death. It means that one should practise this method throughout life and remain in that state even at the time of death.\nWithout closing the gateways of the senses, the mind cannot be turned inwards to concentrate on Atma. The frame of knowledge may easily be put out by the winds of sense-attractions if the gateways are kept open. Here it is said that ‘all’ the senses should be restrained. The restraint should be complete and perfect. It should be understood that without sense-restraint, no other sadhana is possible.\nAlready the Lord has declared “First restrain the senses.” As the tortoise withdraws – all its organs into its shell, so should the yogi withdraw all the senses from their usual external activities in the objective world.\nThen the mind should be centred in the heart, in Atma. The heart, Atma, is the source from which the mind arises. So the mind should be turned back to its own source. When the senses are controlled, the mind naturally loses its roving nature and sinks into its own source.\nThe mind should think of Paramatma in a continuous stream of unbroken consciousness.\nWhat is the ‘mantra’ for meditation? The one-syllable OM, which is Brahman. OM is Pranava. It is the essence of the Vedas. It is not enough merely to utter the word OM but one should think of the Lord. It means that the idea symbolised by the word OM should be thought of. Mere verbal repetition of a ‘mantra’ without thinking of its meaning, will not yield the best results. If a cannon is filled with powder without the shell, it will cause a noisy explosion only, but the target is not reached because there is no shell.

    "translation": "He who closes all the doors of the senses, confines the mind within the heart, draws the prāna into the head, and engages in the practice of yoga, uttering Om, the single syllable denoting Brahman, and meditates on Me— he who so departs, leaving the body, attains the Supreme Goal.",
    "commentary": "The process of meditating on OM and attaining final liberation is explained here. It does not mean that one should follow it only at the time of death. It means that one should practise this method throughout life and remain in that state even at the time of death.\nWithout closing the gateways of the senses, the mind cannot be turned inwards to concentrate on Atma. The frame of knowledge may easily be put out by the winds of sense-attractions if the gateways are kept open. Here it is said that ‘all’ the senses should be restrained. The restraint should be complete and perfect. It should be understood that without sense-restraint, no other sadhana is possible.\nAlready the Lord has declared “First restrain the senses.” As the tortoise withdraws – all its organs into its shell, so should the yogi withdraw all the senses from their usual external activities in the objective world.\nThen the mind should be centred in the heart, in Atma. The heart, Atma, is the source from which the mind arises. So the mind should be turned back to its own source. When the senses are controlled, the mind naturally loses its roving nature and sinks into its own source.\nThe mind should think of Paramatma in a continuous stream of unbroken consciousness.\nWhat is the ‘mantra’ for meditation? The one-syllable OM, which is Brahman. OM is Pranava. It is the essence of the Vedas. It is not enough merely to utter the word OM but one should think of the Lord. It means that the idea symbolised by the word OM should be thought of. Mere verbal repetition of a ‘mantra’ without thinking of its meaning, will not yield the best results. If a cannon is filled with powder without the shell, it will cause a noisy explosion only, but the target is not reached because there is no shell. Similarly, when Pranava is uttered with its meaning in mind, it will lead to the goal. Ceaseless thought of the Lord is the way to Atmajnana.\nThe following points are revealed through these two verses.\nRepetition of a mantra’ (Japa) is not enough.

    "commentary": "The easy way to attain God is here explained. People think that it is very difficult to attain Him. But practising in the right way, He is easily attained. He who thinks of him continuously and always attains Him.\nThe mind should be free from any other thought except the thought of God. Usually, the mind is attached to various things and gets entangled in the meshes of the objective world through the senses. That is why it is said here that one should be filled to the brim with the thought of God continuously and forever. It is not enough to think of Him now and then. Always and every day the thought of God should be present in the mind. Of course, by steady practice day after day, the mind could be trained to think of God more and more. So practising, after a long time, the mind gets fixed and does not turn away from Him. Then the Lord is attained.\nThe seeker should be vigilant and try his best not to yield to the temptations of Maya. The wakeful and watchful man has no fear of falling away from the goal.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda\nSri Ramakrishna Says —\nMASTER (to the Brahmos): “Dive deep. Learn to love God. Plunge into divine love. You see, I have heard how you pray. Why do you Brahmos dwell so much on the glories of God? Is there such great need of your saying over and over again, ‘O God, You have created the sky, the great oceans, the lunar world, the solar world, and the stellar world’?\n“Everybody is wonder-struck at the mere sight of a rich man’s garden house. People become speechless at the sight of the trees, the flowers, the ponds, the drawing-room, the pictures. But alas, how few are they who seek the owner of all these! Only one or two inquire after him. He who seeks God with a longing heart can see Him, talk to Him as I am talking to you. Believe my words when I say that God can be seen. But ah! To whom am I saying these words? Who will believe me?\n“Can one find God in the sacred books? By reading the scriptures one may feel at the most that God exists. But God does not reveal Himself to a man unless he himself dives deep. Only after such a plunge, after the revelation of God through His grace, is one’s doubt destroyed. You may read scriptures by the thousands and recite thousands of texts; but unless you plunge into God with yearning of heart, you will not comprehend Him. By mere scholarship you may fool man, but not God.\n“Scriptures and books — what can one achieve with these alone? Nothing can be realised without His grace. Strive with a longing heart for His grace. Through His grace you will see Him and He will talk to you.”\nSUB-JUDGE:\n“Sir, does God show more grace to one than to another? If so, He can be accused of the fault of partiality.”\nMASTER:\n“What are you saying? Do you mean to say that the moon and a glow-worm are the same, though both give light? Iswar Vidyasagar asked me the same question. He said, ‘Is it a fact, sir, that God gives more power to one and less to another?’\n‘God’, I said, ‘exists in every being as the All-pervading Spirit. He is in the ant as well as in me. But there are different manifestations of His Power in different beings.\nIf all are the same, then why have we come here to see you, attracted by your renown? Have you grown a pair of horns? Oh, no! It is not that. You have compassion; you have scholarship; there is a greater degree of these virtues in you than in others. That is the reason you are so well known.’ Don’t you see that there are men who, single-handed, can defeat a hundred persons? Again, one man takes to his heels in fear of another; you see such a person, too. If there are not different manifestations of power in different beings, then why did people respect Keshab Sen so much?\n“It is said in the\nGita\nthat if a man is respected and honoured by many, whether it be for his scholarship or his music or his oratory or anything else, then you may know for certain that he is endowed with a\nspecial divine power.\n“\n(\nBG 10.41\n)\nA BRAHMO (\nto the sub-judge\n): “Why don’t you accept what he says?”\nMASTER (\nsharply, to the Brahmo\n): “What sort of man are you? To accept words without conviction! Why, that is hypocrisy! I see you are only a counterfeit.”\nThe Brahmo was much embarrassed. (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)",

    "translation": "Having come to Me, these high-souled men are no more subject to rebirth, which is transitory and the abode of pain; for they have reached the highest perfection.",
    "commentary": "It is declared here that those who attained God do not enter samsara. So long as realisation does not come to man he is whirled about in the flood of birth and death. When the truth is known there is no birth, and hence no pain or sorrow. The need for perfect freedom is stated here. Freedom is to be attained for the purpose of transcending pain and sorrow.\nThe Lord makes it clear that the place where man takes birth is the abode of sorrow and is non-eternal. Birth is subject to those two evils. Even if a person feels that he is enjoying something here it is only a shadowy joy, which is mixed with pain. We see that joy is inevitably followed by sorrow as its own shadow. That is why wise men are not tempted by these reflected pleasures. The world is the abode of sorrow.  It is the place where sorrow rules. Out of ignorance and delusion, man imagines that he is enjoying this or that pleasure. But the Lord who knows the truth warns mankind out of infinite compassion – “O ye mortals, do not be deluded, this world is the very abode of pain and sorrow. Seek for that which is true joy and eternal and transcend all sorrow.\n‘\nAvidya\n‘ is the power which deludes man to think of non-eternal as eternal, the impure as pure, and anatma as Atma.\nSo the way to transcend is to attain God. Let everyone take refuge in God in every way, through devotion, knowledge, and dispassion.\nUnion with God is the highest state of freedom and perfection. As many enlightened sages have attained that state, it is suggested that every man can achieve it with adequate will and discrimination. Those who take refuge in God with a pure heart are mahatmas. Those who are entangled in worldly objects are ‘alpatmas,’ – little-minded men. Mahatma is a title. To reject the false and hold on to Truth, to reject the ephemeral and hold on to the Eternal, to reject anatma and hold on to Atma, is the way to attain the highest state of Mahatma. Such enlightened sages do not return to the world which is characterised by pain and sorrow. Those who are desirous of eternal joy should strive with faith and devotion to reach that state.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda",

They are all in the realm of the phenomenal the difference being in their gross or less gross nature. So those who reach the subtler worlds like Svargaloka or Brahmaloka have to return again. They come and go in the same way as this world. But those who have attained Paramatma have no re-birth. This is Moksha. The reason is that all the worlds up to Brahmaloka are objective and so they repeat themselves endlessly. Only Atma which is the ‘Drik’ is not subject to the modifications of time and place. It is imperishable. Having attained it there is no karma, and so there is no birth – Janma.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda",

    "commentary": "In the previous\nverse\n, it was stated that all the worlds up to Brahmaloka are non-eternal, subject to change, and they come and go. Here the Lord gives an estimate of the duration of day and night of Brahma (Creator) and thereby suggests that even Brahma is limited by time. The day of Brahma is thousand yugas and night another thousand yugas. So one complete day and night for Brahma endures two thousand Mahayugas. The following table shows the duration in years:\nKaliyuga\n432000 years\nDvaparayuga\n864000 years (Twice Kaliyuga)\nTretayuga\n1296000 years (Thrice Kaliyuga)\nKritayuga or Satyayuga\n1728000 years (Four times Kaliyuga)\nTotal\n4320000 (1 Mahayuga)\nOne thousand such\nMahayugas\nmake a day, and another one thousand such Mahayugas make a night for Brahma. Three hundred and sixty-five such days make a year, and one hundred such years constitute the life-time of Brahma. What one should understand is that even this astronomical duration of life of Brahma is limited by time. The sage is not interested in anything by time, and the transitory pleasures derived by living in such worlds. He aspires to go beyond time, to realise the immeasurable Paramatma. Whereas everything is conditioned by time, the Lord alone is eternal. In Him, all time, space, and all the worlds are created by the power of His Mayasakti. The wise man takes no thought of the unreal but aspires for the Eternal. He knows what time is, and how time destroys all things, and how he can transcend time by taking refuge in Paramatma.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda",

There is no samsara again for the sage who attains the highest goal. Having lived in the world, it becomes clear that everything is vanishing like a dream. The child of today is the old man of tomorrow. Pleasures turn into pains. Joys lead to sorrow. Life ends in death. The whole scheme of existence is only a troubled dream. Time passes and death takes away all. Knowing this fully from experience the wise man is not at all interested in this child’s play. He has no relish for these insipid things. He knows that the dream life is utterly unbecoming of him, who has the eternal Self as his real Being. So he aims high, aims at Truth, aims at the lion rather than catch a jackal. So the Lord’s inspiring call to mankind is to give up the foolish little self, and ascend to him, and be one with him.\nReaching him, there is no re-birth. Why should man wish to be born in the cage of flesh? Is it to taste the ditch – water of several worldly pleasures again? Why does he crave for such wretched things when he is really the immortal bliss and blessedness. The man of Self-realisation rejects the body as a dirty tattered robe. He does not wish to wear it again. Immortality, bliss and blessedness, he enjoys when he attains the highest abode of the Lord.\nAfter Totāpuri left Dakshineswar the Master determined to return to the nirvikalpa plane. He did so, and as a matter of fact, remained in that state, more or less, for six months. It is a puzzling period of his life, in one sense, since he was cared for not by Hriday or other relatives, nor by Mathur, nor the Brāhmaṇī (all of whom were, apparently, still at Dakshineswar), but by an unknown wandering sādhu, a sojourner at the temple garden. This monk somehow knew that this body, with its matted hair, flies entering mouth and nose, looking more dead than alive, needed to be preserved for the world. Sometimes he would beat that body with a short stick, when, finding a little external consciousness, he would force food into the Master’s mouth.\n‘I was,’ says Ramakrishna, ‘in that state from which ordinary mortals never return.\nThere was no consciousness at all of the coming of day and night. Calls of nature were perhaps answered unconsciously. Then after six months I heard the Mother’s command, “Remain in bhāvamukha for the spiritual enlightenment of men.”16 Twice before, he had heard this command (see Chap. II). Swami Saradananda devotes many pages to the explanation of this term. As we have said, it is a name for the general condition of a mystic’s mind which enables him on the one hand to experience the visions and ecstasies of the personal forms of God; and on the other, to leave the relative behind and plunge into the Absolute. This was to be Sri Ramakrishna’s condition for many years following. As already mentioned (in the Introduction) a devotee who saw him in 1874 testifies to his absorption in samādhi continuously for three days and nights. The Master said on many occasions, ‘The natural tendency of the mind is upwards, towards the nirvikalpa plane. Once in samādhi it does not feel inclined to come down. For your sake it has to be forced down. Even this is not motive enough, so I catch hold of trifling desires, and saying “I will have a smoke “, or “I will drink water”, or “I will eat this or that”, I thus force the mind gradually down to body-consciousness.’ (Source: The Visions of Sri Ramakrishna)\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda",

These questions are answered here. On Paramatma – as the snake is super-imposed on the rope – the whole universe with all the worlds in it is created as a wonderful illusion. As the rope is the basis, Paramatma is the basis, the foundation, the reality of all this illusion. Where is the dream world? It is in man and nowhere else. So also, all this world is in Paramatma. Like the cream, in milk, Paramatma pervades the whole of creation.\nUnswerving devotion to the Lord is the only way to attain Him. Intense devotion and one-pointed concentration are essential for Realisation.\nDispassion, vairagya, towards the whole of the objective universe, and faith in the Lord as the only refuge-this is intense (ananya) bhakti.\nThe perfect does not think of anything else. He attaches no value to the enjoyments, pains, and sufferings of life. He finds that there is only one Reality and in that he takes refuge. Such bhakti leads to the Lord.\nIt is to be noted that the Lord emphasises devotion (bhakti) in every Discourse, whatever may be the yoga taught in it. This shows that devotion is the common ingredient in every type of yoga. All yogas have for their life-element devotion to the Lord.\nThe Lord is Parama Purusha. The Jiva attains that state by devotion, knowledge, and dispassion. That is the aim of human life.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda",

    "translation": "Fire, light, day-time, the bright half of the moon, and the six months of the northward passage of the sun— taking this path, the knowers of Brahman go to Brahman.",
    "commentary": "Knowledge (Jnana) is light; ignorance (Ajnana) is darkness. He who possesses the effulgence of Brahmajnana goes to Brahman.\nThe bright state comes only to the knowers of Brahman and not to others. The word ‘\nJanah\n‘ shows that the realisation of Brahman is open to all without any distinction of caste, sex, religion or race.\nSince Brahmajnana is light, five light-causing things are mentioned here. (1) Fire, (2) Light, (3) Day, (4) The bright fortnight, (5) The northern solstice (Uttarayana). The fifth points the way to the higher worlds of light and knowledge. The Jiva should find his abode in the light of Brahmajnana, the imperishable Self. So he moves upwards into light and not downwards into darkness. The upward look\n(urdhvadrishti)\nis absorption in the light of Atma, and the downward look\n(adhodrishti)\nis in the contemplation of the insentient material – world. Thus the light-producing things are an indication of knowledge and the ascent of man towards Self-realisation. From this state, there is no return.\nSwami Turiyananda: “There is a mention of the Uttarâyana in the Mahabharata. Bhishma was waiting for the Uttarayana. By this no particular time is meant. It only shows that Bhishma had the power to die whenever he chose. The scriptures do not mean by the word Uttarayana any time at all – it only means the Deva or deity identifying himself with that time. We can well understand this. It is like people coming forward to receive a distinguished visitor. I am reminded of an incident in this connection.\n“B. got news that his father was ill. Before he reached the place, the gentleman had expired. As soon as he stepped into the room, he saw a shining figure. He wrote to me that first he thought that perhaps it was his father waiting to meet him. But suddenly the idea flashed to his mind that it might be some angel come there to escort the departing soul. B. of course won’t tell an untruth; he is not the man to do so. Besides, I can very well understand such things as the following statement of the Gitâ :\n“‘Fools do not perceive when the soul departs from the body, or lives in it, or enjoys things through the help of the Gunas. But wise men see it doing all this.’ (\nBG 15.10\n)\n“Swamiji used to say, ‘He who has seen even a ghost is much greater than a mere book-learned Pundit’ because he has got an opportunity to form a conviction about the future life.” (Source: Spiritual Talks by the First Disciples of Sri Ramakrishna)",

    "translation": "Smoke, night, the dark half of the moon, and the six months of the southward passage of the sun— taking this path, the yogi reaches the lunar path and thence returns.",
    "commentary": "As knowledge is light, ignorance (avidya) is darkness. He who takes the later path is reborn again and again. Here the yogi is one who has performed actions with a desire to enjoy the fruits. As he has not understood the secret of Brahmajnana, he is subject to birth after birth. Here, smoke, night, the dark fortnight, stand for the enveloping darkness of ignorance. The Dakshinayana shows the downward path. The yogi who is devoid of Brahmajnana, reaching the lunar sphere, returns to the world again according to the nature of his Karma. The path of avidya is indicated by the southern solstice.\nIt is also necessary to understand the significance of Uttarayana and Dakshinayana. We find that many great souls have passed away in Dakshinayana and many deluded souls have passed away in Uttarayana. If the external meaning alone is taken, it would lead to the absurd conclusion that the ignorant attain the Light and the wise fall into darkness. The wise always take the upward path of light, whatever may be the time when the body falls. The deluded take the path of darkness, whatever may be the time when the body falls. The upward path signifies Jnana and the downward path Ajnana.",

Those who acquire Atmajnana do not return again into the cage of flesh and blood. The others return again and again into the body, till they attain perfection. The two paths are open to man. Which to choose depends on the discrimination of man. If a man ascends into light, he is blessed; if a man descends into darkness, he suffers all the ills of human life.

    "translation": "No yogi who understands these two paths is ever deluded. Therefore, Ο Arjuna, at all times be steadfast in yoga.",
    "commentary": "It is stated here that the yogi who understands the two paths of light and darkness is not deluded. It means that he would never go into darkness and delusion, but always ness is not de rest in the light of knowledge and truth. Having seen what is poison and what is nectar, the wise man rejects the poison and takes the nectar. So also, knowing clearly – this is Atma, that is Anatma, this is light and that is darkness, this is immortality and that is death – who will go into darkness and death? No. He would never allow delusion to come near him. He has understood the secret of life and death, by his discriminatory reason. Therefore the Lord says:- “O Arjuna! Be established in yoga; have your being always in the light of Brahman.” The Lord’s command is to hold the knowledge firm at all times because negligence even for a second would give way for Maya to work evil in the heart of man.\nThe moment when the Lord is forgotten, that very moment causes danger, delusion, harm, and wrong action. The absence of light is darkness. Forgetfulness of Truth is itself the empire of Maya. The moment when man begins to enquire after truth, Maya disappears. When such enquiry lapses even for a moment, Maya enters, declaring ‘I am here’. When people pursue the thief determined to catch him, he runs away and disappears. Such is Maya. It is always in and around the people but when they pursue the enquiry after Truth, it disappears. So the enquiry should be kept up continuously. Man then lives in the light of Truth.\nYogayukto bhava:\nYoga means union with Paramatma, through knowledge, devotion, or dhyana or by any and every means pointed out in the Sastras. To be established in such yoga is what is taught here.",

    "commentary": "This\n— The answers to the seven questions of Arjuna, given in the eighth chapter of the Gītā. One must not merely understand, but also follow, the teachings implied in the answers.\nThe excellence of Brahmajnana is declared here. The knower of the Imperishable Brahman attains the highest state, far beyond any of the meritorious rewards springing from the study of the Vedas, the performance of sacrifices and austerities, and the offering of gifts. Brahman is the only Truth, and having reached it, man attains the Supreme state. tams the Supreme st\nIt is true that several meritorious rewards come to man through the performance of sacrifices etc. But they are all in the realm of Maya; they have an end; they are not eternal. Therefore the yogi aspires to attain that state in which all the rewards of all the good works are comprehended and fulfilled. And that state is the realisation of Brahman, the only Reality.\nBrahmajnana transcends all the merits derived from the study of the Vedas, or sacrifices or other good works. Fifty is included in the hundred. So the person who attains the hundred includes the fifty and transcends it also. Brahmajnana is ‘mahapunya’. The lesser fruits of other meritorious deeds are included in it. Whereas all other rewards end in time, the yogi of brahmajnana lives in eternal bliss.\nThere are many illiterate people who cannot study the Vedas. There are many people who are physically weak and so cannot perform austerities. There are poor people who cannot offer meritorious gifts. What shall be the fate of all these people? Is there no way of liberation for them? The Lord here declares that by the contemplation and understanding of Brahman, they shall attain the highest state, and obtain all the rewards of all the meritorious acts done by others. Purity of mind and heart, and purity in devotion are the only things needed. The study of the Vedas, tapas, and dhyana, if they are performed without attachment, purifies the heart of man enabling him to attain Brahmajnana.\nBrahmajnana is the highest state. The seekers, in the beginning, may undertake all the good works enjoined in the Sastras. But let them not stop there, for, the goal is Self-relisation, and no one should stop at any intermediate stage. With Brahmajnana the quest for the Supreme stops, and man is eternally satisfied.",
