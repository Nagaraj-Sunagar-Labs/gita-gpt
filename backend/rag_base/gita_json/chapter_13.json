    "commentary": "Arjuna now questions the Lord about the attributeless Brahma. In the Gita, the first six chapters (1-6) are known as ‘\nKarmashtakam\n‘ dealing with karma yoga; the second six chapters (7-12) are known as ‘\nBhaktishtakam\n‘ dealing with ‘\nBhakti\n‘, and the last six chapters (13-18) are known as ‘\nJnanashatakam\n‘ dealing with ‘\nJnana\n‘. So in this Discourse, the subject of knowledge is taken up for detailed investigation. For the aspirant in the ‘Jnanamarga’, this Discourse is of great importance.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda",

    "translation": "The Lord said: This body, Ο son of Kunti, is called the Field, and he who knows it is called the Knower of the Field by those who describe them.",
    "commentary": "‘\nKshetram\n‘ means field. The field is necessary for growing corn and other things to sustain the beings of the world. So also the body is necessary for the growth of the seed of knowledge in the heart of man. All ‘sadhana’, ‘tapas’, thinking and meditation – all this is to be done with the body. So the body, the ‘kshetra’, is the field for the growth of the, seed of ‘Dharma’ as well as ‘Jnana’. Therefore it is called ‘kshetra’.\nThe body being inert (Jada’) does not know itself; There is a consciousness within with power to cognise the body. This consciousness power is known as ‘\nkshetrajna\n.’ He is ‘Pratyagatma’. He is the witness of the combined elements of the body, senses and the mind. He is changeless, pure, intelligence, deathless, separate from the five sheaths (\nPanchakosas\n). What is inert cannot know itself. The wall does not know that it is a wall, nor does a pot know that it is a pot. It is intelligence that has the power of cognition. That Intelligence is the Knower of the body. He knows. He (‘\nkshetrajna\n‘) is pure Intelligence.\nThe knower of the field is certainly different from the field. So the knower of the body should certainly be distinct from the body. Though Intelligence is in the body, yet it remains free and perfect, witnessing the modifications of the body and mind during all the three states of wakefulness ‘Jagrat’, dream ‘Svapna’ and sleep ‘Sushupti’.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda\nBhagavad Gita 13.2 – 13.3 by Swami Shuddhidananda\nThe Field & The Field Knower by Swami Sarvapriyananda | Bhagavad Gita 13.2 – 13.3\nWhat we had referred to earlier as Prakṛti and Purusha are now being spoken of by Bhagavan as kshetra and kshetrajña.\nThis body is referred to as the kṣetra, and the Consciousness within is the kṣetrajña. They are also called Prakṛti and Purusha, respectively. In the seventh chapter, we spoke about aparā-prakṛti and parā-prakṛti. Kṣetra is aparā-prakṛti and kṣetrajña is parā-prakṛti.",

    "commentary": "In this verse, the Lord teaches the Mahavakya ‘tat tvam asi’ (Thou art That). In the\nSecond Discourse\nin the verse\n‘Na tvevaham jatu nasam’\n(2.12)\n, the Lord has already taught the Mahavakya, the highest truth. The Jiva is no other than Siva. The Jiva (really Pratyagatman) is the Knower of the field, the witness to the modifications of the body and mind, and this Jiva is not distinct from Paramatma, is actually one with Him. “Know Me as the Knower of the body in all the bodies”. So the Jiva who is the Knower in a particular body is Paramatma Himself, who is also the knower in everybody. There is therefore only one Knower and He is functioning in everybody as the witness. The Lord Himself is the Knower in all the bodies. The ‘Jiva’ is only a fictitious entity and has no real existence at all apart from the Lord. To know this Truth fully and finally is the highest achievement of man.\nThis knowledge gives to every man the greatest strength and courage. Why should one weep and wail? Why should he suffer the miseries of life? Let him remember that the Lord is actually, directly present in him. This is the truth. No other kind of knowledge except this can give man supreme joy and blissfulness. Knowledge of the sciences, arts and politics, is incomplete and one-sided. There is no perfection in them. There is no finality in them. They keep man where he is. This knowledge of the kshetrajna transforms man into a Divine Being. He understands the tremendous mystery of the human personality.",

    "commentary": "In this Discourse, both knowledge and the object of Knowledge are explained. The moral and spiritual qualities needed for Self-realisation are stated as Knowledge (Jnanam) here. Without perfect command of these qualities, no one can attain Paramatma. When the mirror is pure, the reflection is clear, not otherwise. Thus when the mind is purified by spiritual qualities, the Self is clearly reflected in it. So the seeker has to cultivate these qualities of jnanam first, and the self-existent Paramatman is revealed spontaneously without any effort on the part of man. All effort, all practice, all ‘sadhana’ is needed to purify the mind by the acquisition of these moral and spiritual qualities. There ends all effort. The Realisation of Paramatman occurs by itself. No effort is needed. Twenty spiritual qualities are mentioned here. The seeker has to understand each one of them and make them all part of his own personality.\nacharyopasanam:\nService to the Guru is an essential factor in spiritual life. Without the benediction of God and Guru, no advancement is possible. Knowledge of Atma is attained by their grace. (\n4.34\n)\nsaucham:\nPurity both internal and external is another essential factor of spiritual life. The mind and body should be washed clean of all their dirt and foul passions.\nsthairyam:\nThe seeker should be firm, determined and resolute. His decision should be unalterable. The views and opinions of worldly men should not be allowed to loosen the firmness of one’s own conviction about spiritual truth.\natmavinigrahah:\nHere the word Atman stands for senses and mind. They should be thoroughly brought under control, without any fear of rebellion from them at any time. The power of Maya can easily trap up a man, if his self-control is partial or inadequate.\nindriyartheshu vairagyam:\nDispassion for sense-objects is the test of a jnani. The man of knowledge is never tempted by the attractions of the sense-world. If the mind runs after sense pleasures, it cannot be brought to rest in the Self. Meditation is not possible. The seeker has to develop ‘vairagya’ as the very life element of spiritual progress. He should turn the mind inwards to look into the Self by withdrawing it from its usual wanderings in the objective world.\njanmamrityu jaravyadhi dukha doshanudarsanam:\nGenerally people are able to understand the evils of old age, disease and death. But they do not understand the evils of birth. When a child is born people feel happy. But the Lord here says that birth itself is evil and sorrowful. Because all the ensuing ills and miseries of life come after birth. When there is no birth, there is no body; when there is no body there is no old age or disease or death. That is why both birth and death are said to form the cycle of ‘samsara’. The man who desires to escape death, should also avoid birth. One cannot be had without the other. The true aspirant thinks deeply and sees clearly (\nanudarsanam\n) all the evils arising from material life. By such contemplation, he develops a deep inspiration to transcend these evils by every means possible. He finds ultimately that he is not the body, but Atma, the unborn and deathless, free from all the modifications of body and mind. Thus he transcends death. This habit of the mind to see the evils of life and death is of utmost importance in the path of knowledge.\nasaktir anabhishvangah putradaragrihadishu:\nThe house-holders should think of this aspect of jnana. He should understand that these things like wife and children, positions and possessions, do not really belong to him. It does not mean that he should abandon them. The idea is that there should not be any mental attachment for them. He should realise that he has nothing to do with them, though externally he discharges all the duties of a house-holder.\nsamachittatvam:\nEquanimity of mind under all circumstances is again the essence of jnana. The wise man is constant and steady whatever may happen, because he knows that he is not the kshetra, but the kshetrajna. So he is indifferent to joy or sorrow, good fortune or ill-fate.\nbhaktiravyabhicharini:\nThe Lord mentions devotion to Him as one of the qualities of Knowledge. This devotion should be constant and continuous, and it should not be diverted toward any other object in the world. Though in the beginning, such single-minded devotion is not possible, yet by resolute practice he should attain that state when the mind rests steadfast in the Lord and does not move away from Him.\nviviktadesa sevitvam:\nIn the early stages the company of worldly-minded people causes great distraction (\nvikshepa\n), and so the seeker is required to resort to solitary places for silent thinking and meditation. It is quite possible to create such silence and solitude in one’s own house by keeping a room separately for purposes of study and meditation. As the seeker advances, he takes to silence and solitude naturally.\naratirjanasamsadi:\nThe company of indifferent people should be avoided. ‘\nSatsang\n‘ is always desirable.\nadhyatmajnana nityatvam:\nConstancy of Divine contemplation and knowledge is taught here. The light of knowledge should be steady and bright in the heart always. If the light is extinguished, darkness immediately envelops the heart of man. When jnana is lost, ajnana enters at once. When ajnana is put off, jnana dawns at once. They are like light and darkness. When the one is, the other is not. The seekers should remember the Lord’s instruction and try to be aware of the truth at all times. Such awareness keeps off ‘avidya’ from possessing the heart of man.\ntatvajnanartha darsanam:\nDirect experience of the truth is one of the important qualities of a jnani. It is not speculation or logic or argument, but actual perception of Atma, which is Brahmajnana.\najnanam yadatonyatha:\nWhat is igorance? What is not jnana is ignorance. The Lord need not explain what ignorance is. Everybody knows it already. Pride and arrogance, selfishness, envy and jealousy, ill-will, hatred and a host of evil passions, desires, hopes and fears which beset the mind constitue ignorance.\nBhagavad Gita 13.8 by Swami Chetanananda\nBhagavad Gita 13.9 to 13.12 by Swami Chetanananda\nBhagavad Gita 13.8 to 13.9 by Swami Shuddhidananda\nBhagavad Gita 13.10 to 13.12 by Swami Shuddhidananda\nSri Ramakrishna Says —\n(To Amrita and Trailokya) “Youngsters like Narendra and Rakhal are ever-perfect. Every time they are born they are devoted to God. An ordinary man acquires a little devotion after austerities and a hard struggle. But these boys have love of God from the very moment of their birth. They are like the natural image of Siva, which springs forth from the earth and is not set up by human hands.\n“The ever-perfect form a class by themselves. Not all birds have crooked beaks. The ever-perfect are never attached to the world. There is the instance of Prahlada.\n“Ordinary people practise spiritual discipline and cultivate devotion to God; but they also become attached to the world and are caught in the clamour of ‘woman and gold’. They are like flies, which sit on a flower or a sweetmeat and light on filth as well.\n“But the ever-perfect are like bees, which light only on flowers and sip the honey. The ever-perfect drink only the Nectar of Divine Bliss. They are never inclined to worldly pleasures.\n(Mam Eva\nBG 7.14\n)\n“The devotion of the ever-perfect is not like the ordinary devotion that one acquires as a result of strenuous spiritual discipline. Ritualistic devotion consists in repeating the name of God and performing worship in a prescribed manner. It is like crossing a rice-field in a roundabout way along the balk. Again, it is like reaching a near-by village by boat in a roundabout way along a winding river.\n“One does not follow the injunctions of ceremonial worship when one develops raga-bhakti, when one loves God as one’s own. Then it is like crossing a rice-field after the harvest. You don’t have to walk along the balk. You can go straight across the field in any direction.\n“When the country is flooded deep with water, one doesn’t have to follow the winding river. Then the fields are deep under water. You can row your boat straight to the village.\n“Without this intense attachment, this passionate love, one cannot realise God.”\nAMRITA:\n“Sir, how do you feel in samadhi?”\nMASTER:\n“You may have heard that the cockroach, by intently meditating on the brahmara, is transformed into a brahmara. Do you know how I feel then? I feel like a fish released from a pot into the water of the Ganges.”\nAMRITA:\n“Don’t you feel at that time even a trace of ego?”\nMASTER:\n“Yes, generally a little of it remains. However hard you may rub a grain of gold against a grindstone, still a bit of it always remains. Or again, take the case of a big fire; the ego is like one of its sparks. In samadhi I lose outer consciousness completely; but God generally keeps a little trace of ego in me for the enjoyment of divine communion. Enjoyment is possible only when ‘I’ and ‘you’ remain.\n“Again, sometimes God effaces even that trace of ‘I’. Then one experiences jada samadhi or nirvikalpa samadhi. That experience cannot be described. A salt doll went to measure the depth of the ocean, but before it had gone far into the water it melted away. It became entirely one with the water of the ocean. Then who was to come back and tell the ocean’s depth?” (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\n—–\nMASTER:\n“You talk glibly about prema. But is it such a commonplace thing? There are two characteristics of prema.\nFirst, it makes one forget the world.\nSo intense is one’s love of God that one becomes unconscious of outer things. Chaitanya had this ecstatic love; he ‘took a wood for the sacred grove of Vrindavan and the ocean for the dark waters of the Jamuna’.\nSecond, one has no feeling of ‘my-ness’ toward the body, which is so dear to man.\nOne wholly gets rid of the feeling that the body is the soul.\n“There are certain signs of God-realisation. The man in whom longing for God manifests its glories is not far from attaining Him. What are the glories of that longing? They are discrimination, dispassion, compassion for living beings, serving holy men, loving their company, chanting the name and glories of God, telling the truth, and the like. When you see those signs of longing in an aspirant, you can rightly say that for him the vision of God is not far to seek.\n“The state of a servant’s house will tell you unmistakably whether his master has decided to visit it. First, the rubbish and jungle around the house are cleared up. Second, the soot and dirt are removed from the rooms. Third, the courtyard, floors, and other places are swept clean. Finally the master himself sends various things to the house, such as a carpet, a hubble-bubble for smoking, and the like. When you see these things arriving, you conclude that the master will very soon come.”\nA DEVOTEE:\n“Sir, should one first practise discrimination to attain self-control?”\nMASTER:\n“That is also a path. It is called the path of vichara, reasoning. But the inner organs (Mind (manas), intelligence (buddhi), mind-stuff (chitta), and ego (ahamkara).) are brought under control naturally through the path of devotion as well. It is rather easily accomplished that way. Sense pleasures appear more and more tasteless as love for God grows. Can carnal pleasure attract a grief-stricken man and woman the day their child has died?”\nDEVOTEE:\n“How can I develop love for God?”\nMASTER:\n“Repeat His name, and sins will disappear. Thus you will destroy lust, anger, the desire for creature comforts, and so on.”\nDEVOTEE:\n“How can I take delight in God’s name?”\nMASTER:\n“Pray to God with a yearning heart that you may take delight in His name. He will certainly fulfil your heart’s desire.”\nSo saying, the Master sang a song in his sweet voice, pleading with the Divine Mother to show Her grace to suffering men:\nO Mother, I have no one else to blame:\nAlas!

    "translation": "Humbleness; freedom from hypocrisy; non-violence; forgiveness; simplicity; service of the Guru; cleanliness of body and mind; steadfastness; and self-control; dispassion toward the objects of the senses; absence of egotism; keeping in mind the evils of birth, disease, old age, and death; non-attachment; absence of clinging to spouse, children, home, and so on; even-mindedness amidst desired and undesired events in life; constant and exclusive devotion toward Me; an inclination for solitary places and an aversion for mundane society; constancy in spiritual knowledge; and philosophical pursuit of the Absolute Truth—all these I declare to be knowledge, and what is contrary to it, I call ignorance.",
    "commentary": "In this Discourse, both knowledge and the object of Knowledge are explained. The moral and spiritual qualities needed for Self-realisation are stated as Knowledge (Jnanam) here. Without perfect command of these qualities, no one can attain Paramatma. When the mirror is pure, the reflection is clear, not otherwise. Thus when the mind is purified by spiritual qualities, the Self is clearly reflected in it. So the seeker has to cultivate these qualities of jnanam first, and the self-existent Paramatman is revealed spontaneously without any effort on the part of man. All effort, all practice, all ‘sadhana’ is needed to purify the mind by the acquisition of these moral and spiritual qualities. There ends all effort. The Realisation of Paramatman occurs by itself. No effort is needed. Twenty spiritual qualities are mentioned here. The seeker has to understand each one of them and make them all part of his own personality.\nacharyopasanam:\nService to the Guru is an essential factor in spiritual life. Without the benediction of God and Guru, no advancement is possible. Knowledge of Atma is attained by their grace. (\n4.34\n)\nsaucham:\nPurity both internal and external is another essential factor of spiritual life. The mind and body should be washed clean of all their dirt and foul passions.\nsthairyam:\nThe seeker should be firm, determined and resolute. His decision should be unalterable. The views and opinions of worldly men should not be allowed to loosen the firmness of one’s own conviction about spiritual truth.\natmavinigrahah:\nHere the word Atman stands for senses and mind. They should be thoroughly brought under control, without any fear of rebellion from them at any time. The power of Maya can easily trap up a man, if his self-control is partial or inadequate.\nindriyartheshu vairagyam:\nDispassion for sense-objects is the test of a jnani. The man of knowledge is never tempted by the attractions of the sense-world. If the mind runs after sense pleasures, it cannot be brought to rest in the Self. Meditation is not possible. The seeker has to develop ‘vairagya’ as the very life element of spiritual progress. He should turn the mind inwards to look into the Self by withdrawing it from its usual wanderings in the objective world.\njanmamrityu jaravyadhi dukha doshanudarsanam:\nGenerally people are able to understand the evils of old age, disease and death. But they do not understand the evils of birth. When a child is born people feel happy. But the Lord here says that birth itself is evil and sorrowful. Because all the ensuing ills and miseries of life come after birth. When there is no birth, there is no body; when there is no body there is no old age or disease or death. That is why both birth and death are said to form the cycle of ‘samsara’. The man who desires to escape death, should also avoid birth. One cannot be had without the other. The true aspirant thinks deeply and sees clearly (\nanudarsanam\n) all the evils arising from material life. By such contemplation, he develops a deep inspiration to transcend these evils by every means possible. He finds ultimately that he is not the body, but Atma, the unborn and deathless, free from all the modifications of body and mind. Thus he transcends death. This habit of the mind to see the evils of life and death is of utmost importance in the path of knowledge.\nasaktir anabhishvangah putradaragrihadishu:\nThe house-holders should think of this aspect of jnana. He should understand that these things like wife and children, positions and possessions, do not really belong to him. It does not mean that he should abandon them. The idea is that there should not be any mental attachment for them. He should realise that he has nothing to do with them, though externally he discharges all the duties of a house-holder.\nsamachittatvam:\nEquanimity of mind under all circumstances is again the essence of jnana. The wise man is constant and steady whatever may happen, because he knows that he is not the kshetra, but the kshetrajna. So he is indifferent to joy or sorrow, good fortune or ill-fate.\nbhaktiravyabhicharini:\nThe Lord mentions devotion to Him as one of the qualities of Knowledge. This devotion should be constant and continuous, and it should not be diverted toward any other object in the world. Though in the beginning, such single-minded devotion is not possible, yet by resolute practice he should attain that state when the mind rests steadfast in the Lord and does not move away from Him.\nviviktadesa sevitvam:\nIn the early stages the company of worldly-minded people causes great distraction (\nvikshepa\n), and so the seeker is required to resort to solitary places for silent thinking and meditation. It is quite possible to create such silence and solitude in one’s own house by keeping a room separately for purposes of study and meditation. As the seeker advances, he takes to silence and solitude naturally.\naratirjanasamsadi:\nThe company of indifferent people should be avoided. ‘\nSatsang\n‘ is always desirable.\nadhyatmajnana nityatvam:\nConstancy of Divine contemplation and knowledge is taught here. The light of knowledge should be steady and bright in the heart always. If the light is extinguished, darkness immediately envelops the heart of man. When jnana is lost, ajnana enters at once. When ajnana is put off, jnana dawns at once. They are like light and darkness. When the one is, the other is not. The seekers should remember the Lord’s instruction and try to be aware of the truth at all times. Such awareness keeps off ‘avidya’ from possessing the heart of man.\ntatvajnanartha darsanam:\nDirect experience of the truth is one of the important qualities of a jnani. It is not speculation or logic or argument, but actual perception of Atma, which is Brahmajnana.\najnanam yadatonyatha:\nWhat is igorance? What is not jnana is ignorance. The Lord need not explain what ignorance is. Everybody knows it already. Pride and arrogance, selfishness, envy and jealousy, ill-will, hatred and a host of evil passions, desires, hopes and fears which beset the mind constitue ignorance.\nBhagavad Gita 13.8 by Swami Chetanananda\nBhagavad Gita 13.9 to 13.12 by Swami Chetanananda\nBhagavad Gita 13.8 to 13.9 by Swami Shuddhidananda\nBhagavad Gita 13.10 to 13.12 by Swami Shuddhidananda\nSri Ramakrishna Says —\n(To Amrita and Trailokya) “Youngsters like Narendra and Rakhal are ever-perfect. Every time they are born they are devoted to God. An ordinary man acquires a little devotion after austerities and a hard struggle. But these boys have love of God from the very moment of their birth. They are like the natural image of Siva, which springs forth from the earth and is not set up by human hands.\n“The ever-perfect form a class by themselves. Not all birds have crooked beaks. The ever-perfect are never attached to the world. There is the instance of Prahlada.\n“Ordinary people practise spiritual discipline and cultivate devotion to God; but they also become attached to the world and are caught in the clamour of ‘woman and gold’. They are like flies, which sit on a flower or a sweetmeat and light on filth as well.\n“But the ever-perfect are like bees, which light only on flowers and sip the honey. The ever-perfect drink only the Nectar of Divine Bliss. They are never inclined to worldly pleasures.\n(Mam Eva\nBG 7.14\n)\n“The devotion of the ever-perfect is not like the ordinary devotion that one acquires as a result of strenuous spiritual discipline. Ritualistic devotion consists in repeating the name of God and performing worship in a prescribed manner. It is like crossing a rice-field in a roundabout way along the balk. Again, it is like reaching a near-by village by boat in a roundabout way along a winding river.\n“One does not follow the injunctions of ceremonial worship when one develops raga-bhakti, when one loves God as one’s own. Then it is like crossing a rice-field after the harvest. You don’t have to walk along the balk. You can go straight across the field in any direction.\n“When the country is flooded deep with water, one doesn’t have to follow the winding river. Then the fields are deep under water. You can row your boat straight to the village.\n“Without this intense attachment, this passionate love, one cannot realise God.”\nAMRITA:\n“Sir, how do you feel in samadhi?”\nMASTER:\n“You may have heard that the cockroach, by intently meditating on the brahmara, is transformed into a brahmara. Do you know how I feel then? I feel like a fish released from a pot into the water of the Ganges.”\nAMRITA:\n“Don’t you feel at that time even a trace of ego?”\nMASTER:\n“Yes, generally a little of it remains. However hard you may rub a grain of gold against a grindstone, still a bit of it always remains. Or again, take the case of a big fire; the ego is like one of its sparks. In samadhi I lose outer consciousness completely; but God generally keeps a little trace of ego in me for the enjoyment of divine communion. Enjoyment is possible only when ‘I’ and ‘you’ remain.\n“Again, sometimes God effaces even that trace of ‘I’. Then one experiences jada samadhi or nirvikalpa samadhi. That experience cannot be described. A salt doll went to measure the depth of the ocean, but before it had gone far into the water it melted away. It became entirely one with the water of the ocean.

He should turn the mind inwards to look into the Self by withdrawing it from its usual wanderings in the objective world.\njanmamrityu jaravyadhi dukha doshanudarsanam:\nGenerally people are able to understand the evils of old age, disease and death. But they do not understand the evils of birth. When a child is born people feel happy. But the Lord here says that birth itself is evil and sorrowful. Because all the ensuing ills and miseries of life come after birth. When there is no birth, there is no body; when there is no body there is no old age or disease or death. That is why both birth and death are said to form the cycle of ‘samsara’. The man who desires to escape death, should also avoid birth. One cannot be had without the other. The true aspirant thinks deeply and sees clearly (\nanudarsanam\n) all the evils arising from material life. By such contemplation, he develops a deep inspiration to transcend these evils by every means possible. He finds ultimately that he is not the body, but Atma, the unborn and deathless, free from all the modifications of body and mind. Thus he transcends death. This habit of the mind to see the evils of life and death is of utmost importance in the path of knowledge.\nasaktir anabhishvangah putradaragrihadishu:\nThe house-holders should think of this aspect of jnana. He should understand that these things like wife and children, positions and possessions, do not really belong to him. It does not mean that he should abandon them. The idea is that there should not be any mental attachment for them. He should realise that he has nothing to do with them, though externally he discharges all the duties of a house-holder.\nsamachittatvam:\nEquanimity of mind under all circumstances is again the essence of jnana. The wise man is constant and steady whatever may happen, because he knows that he is not the kshetra, but the kshetrajna. So he is indifferent to joy or sorrow, good fortune or ill-fate.\nbhaktiravyabhicharini:\nThe Lord mentions devotion to Him as one of the qualities of Knowledge. This devotion should be constant and continuous, and it should not be diverted toward any other object in the world. Though in the beginning, such single-minded devotion is not possible, yet by resolute practice he should attain that state when the mind rests steadfast in the Lord and does not move away from Him.\nviviktadesa sevitvam:\nIn the early stages the company of worldly-minded people causes great distraction (\nvikshepa\n), and so the seeker is required to resort to solitary places for silent thinking and meditation. It is quite possible to create such silence and solitude in one’s own house by keeping a room separately for purposes of study and meditation. As the seeker advances, he takes to silence and solitude naturally.\naratirjanasamsadi:\nThe company of indifferent people should be avoided. ‘\nSatsang\n‘ is always desirable.\nadhyatmajnana nityatvam:\nConstancy of Divine contemplation and knowledge is taught here. The light of knowledge should be steady and bright in the heart always. If the light is extinguished, darkness immediately envelops the heart of man. When jnana is lost, ajnana enters at once. When ajnana is put off, jnana dawns at once. They are like light and darkness. When the one is, the other is not. The seekers should remember the Lord’s instruction and try to be aware of the truth at all times. Such awareness keeps off ‘avidya’ from possessing the heart of man.\ntatvajnanartha darsanam:\nDirect experience of the truth is one of the important qualities of a jnani. It is not speculation or logic or argument, but actual perception of Atma, which is Brahmajnana.\najnanam yadatonyatha:\nWhat is igorance? What is not jnana is ignorance. The Lord need not explain what ignorance is. Everybody knows it already. Pride and arrogance, selfishness, envy and jealousy, ill-will, hatred and a host of evil passions, desires, hopes and fears which beset the mind constitue ignorance.\nBhagavad Gita 13.8 by Swami Chetanananda\nBhagavad Gita 13.9 to 13.12 by Swami Chetanananda\nBhagavad Gita 13.8 to 13.9 by Swami Shuddhidananda\nBhagavad Gita 13.10 to 13.12 by Swami Shuddhidananda\nSri Ramakrishna Says —\n(To Amrita and Trailokya) “Youngsters like Narendra and Rakhal are ever-perfect. Every time they are born they are devoted to God. An ordinary man acquires a little devotion after austerities and a hard struggle. But these boys have love of God from the very moment of their birth. They are like the natural image of Siva, which springs forth from the earth and is not set up by human hands.\n“The ever-perfect form a class by themselves. Not all birds have crooked beaks. The ever-perfect are never attached to the world. There is the instance of Prahlada.\n“Ordinary people practise spiritual discipline and cultivate devotion to God; but they also become attached to the world and are caught in the clamour of ‘woman and gold’. They are like flies, which sit on a flower or a sweetmeat and light on filth as well.\n“But the ever-perfect are like bees, which light only on flowers and sip the honey. The ever-perfect drink only the Nectar of Divine Bliss. They are never inclined to worldly pleasures.\n(Mam Eva\nBG 7.14\n)\n“The devotion of the ever-perfect is not like the ordinary devotion that one acquires as a result of strenuous spiritual discipline. Ritualistic devotion consists in repeating the name of God and performing worship in a prescribed manner. It is like crossing a rice-field in a roundabout way along the balk. Again, it is like reaching a near-by village by boat in a roundabout way along a winding river.\n“One does not follow the injunctions of ceremonial worship when one develops raga-bhakti, when one loves God as one’s own. Then it is like crossing a rice-field after the harvest. You don’t have to walk along the balk. You can go straight across the field in any direction.\n“When the country is flooded deep with water, one doesn’t have to follow the winding river. Then the fields are deep under water. You can row your boat straight to the village.\n“Without this intense attachment, this passionate love, one cannot realise God.”\nAMRITA:\n“Sir, how do you feel in samadhi?”\nMASTER:\n“You may have heard that the cockroach, by intently meditating on the brahmara, is transformed into a brahmara. Do you know how I feel then? I feel like a fish released from a pot into the water of the Ganges.”\nAMRITA:\n“Don’t you feel at that time even a trace of ego?”\nMASTER:\n“Yes, generally a little of it remains. However hard you may rub a grain of gold against a grindstone, still a bit of it always remains. Or again, take the case of a big fire; the ego is like one of its sparks. In samadhi I lose outer consciousness completely; but God generally keeps a little trace of ego in me for the enjoyment of divine communion. Enjoyment is possible only when ‘I’ and ‘you’ remain.\n“Again, sometimes God effaces even that trace of ‘I’. Then one experiences jada samadhi or nirvikalpa samadhi. That experience cannot be described. A salt doll went to measure the depth of the ocean, but before it had gone far into the water it melted away. It became entirely one with the water of the ocean. Then who was to come back and tell the ocean’s depth?” (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\n—–\nMASTER:\n“You talk glibly about prema. But is it such a commonplace thing? There are two characteristics of prema.\nFirst, it makes one forget the world.\nSo intense is one’s love of God that one becomes unconscious of outer things. Chaitanya had this ecstatic love; he ‘took a wood for the sacred grove of Vrindavan and the ocean for the dark waters of the Jamuna’.\nSecond, one has no feeling of ‘my-ness’ toward the body, which is so dear to man.\nOne wholly gets rid of the feeling that the body is the soul.\n“There are certain signs of God-realisation. The man in whom longing for God manifests its glories is not far from attaining Him. What are the glories of that longing? They are discrimination, dispassion, compassion for living beings, serving holy men, loving their company, chanting the name and glories of God, telling the truth, and the like. When you see those signs of longing in an aspirant, you can rightly say that for him the vision of God is not far to seek.\n“The state of a servant’s house will tell you unmistakably whether his master has decided to visit it. First, the rubbish and jungle around the house are cleared up. Second, the soot and dirt are removed from the rooms. Third, the courtyard, floors, and other places are swept clean. Finally the master himself sends various things to the house, such as a carpet, a hubble-bubble for smoking, and the like. When you see these things arriving, you conclude that the master will very soon come.”\nA DEVOTEE:\n“Sir, should one first practise discrimination to attain self-control?”\nMASTER:\n“That is also a path. It is called the path of vichara, reasoning. But the inner organs (Mind (manas), intelligence (buddhi), mind-stuff (chitta), and ego (ahamkara).) are brought under control naturally through the path of devotion as well. It is rather easily accomplished that way. Sense pleasures appear more and more tasteless as love for God grows. Can carnal pleasure attract a grief-stricken man and woman the day their child has died?”\nDEVOTEE:\n“How can I develop love for God?”\nMASTER:\n“Repeat His name, and sins will disappear. Thus you will destroy lust, anger, the desire for creature comforts, and so on.”\nDEVOTEE:\n“How can I take delight in God’s name?”\nMASTER:\n“Pray to God with a yearning heart that you may take delight in His name. He will certainly fulfil your heart’s desire.”\nSo saying, the Master sang a song in his sweet voice, pleading with the Divine Mother to show Her grace to suffering men:\nO Mother, I have no one else to blame:\nAlas! I sink in the well these very hands have dug. ….. (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)",

    "translation": "Humbleness; freedom from hypocrisy; non-violence; forgiveness; simplicity; service of the Guru; cleanliness of body and mind; steadfastness; and self-control; dispassion toward the objects of the senses; absence of egotism; keeping in mind the evils of birth, disease, old age, and death; non-attachment; absence of clinging to spouse, children, home, and so on; even-mindedness amidst desired and undesired events in life; constant and exclusive devotion toward Me; an inclination for solitary places and an aversion for mundane society; constancy in spiritual knowledge; and philosophical pursuit of the Absolute Truth—all these I declare to be knowledge, and what is contrary to it, I call ignorance.",
    "commentary": "In this Discourse, both knowledge and the object of Knowledge are explained. The moral and spiritual qualities needed for Self-realisation are stated as Knowledge (Jnanam) here. Without perfect command of these qualities, no one can attain Paramatma. When the mirror is pure, the reflection is clear, not otherwise. Thus when the mind is purified by spiritual qualities, the Self is clearly reflected in it. So the seeker has to cultivate these qualities of jnanam first, and the self-existent Paramatman is revealed spontaneously without any effort on the part of man. All effort, all practice, all ‘sadhana’ is needed to purify the mind by the acquisition of these moral and spiritual qualities. There ends all effort. The Realisation of Paramatman occurs by itself. No effort is needed. Twenty spiritual qualities are mentioned here. The seeker has to understand each one of them and make them all part of his own personality.\nacharyopasanam:\nService to the Guru is an essential factor in spiritual life. Without the benediction of God and Guru, no advancement is possible. Knowledge of Atma is attained by their grace. (\n4.34\n)\nsaucham:\nPurity both internal and external is another essential factor of spiritual life. The mind and body should be washed clean of all their dirt and foul passions.\nsthairyam:\nThe seeker should be firm, determined and resolute. His decision should be unalterable. The views and opinions of worldly men should not be allowed to loosen the firmness of one’s own conviction about spiritual truth.\natmavinigrahah:\nHere the word Atman stands for senses and mind. They should be thoroughly brought under control, without any fear of rebellion from them at any time. The power of Maya can easily trap up a man, if his self-control is partial or inadequate.\nindriyartheshu vairagyam:\nDispassion for sense-objects is the test of a jnani. The man of knowledge is never tempted by the attractions of the sense-world. If the mind runs after sense pleasures, it cannot be brought to rest in the Self. Meditation is not possible.

    "translation": "I will now describe that which ought to be known, through the knowing of which one attains Immortality. It is the Supreme Brahman, which is without beginning and is said to be neither being nor non-being.",
    "commentary": "From this verse onwards in six verses, the Lord explains the nature of that which is to be known, the supreme Brahman. The former\nverses (8-12)\ndealt with knowledge and its qualities. But that is not enough. Knowledge of what? What is it that the man of wisdom knows? What does knowledge lead to? What is that to be known? These questions are answered now by the Lord. Having abandoned bad qualities, the aspirant acquires good qualities, and then abandoning both, he attains the supreme Brahman. This is the state of perfection. All the other states are imperfect.\nSome of the religions are content with the teaching of ethical principles and a moral code of conduct. It is good in itself, but that is not enough. The aspirant should purify himself by ethical conduct, and then find his identity with the Supreme. That is the ultimate goal. There is no resting ground anywhere below that state. Therefore in the Gita, the Lord takes his disciple to the highest rung of the spiritual ladder and leaves him there – the Advaita realisation of Nirguna Brahman. The Gita explains Dvaita Visishtadvaita and Advaita one after another and so it is said to be the one complete spiritual Sastra.",

But still we use ‘\nSatanama\n‘ and ‘\nsahasranamas\n‘ while worshiping God.  The words ‘\nSata\nand ‘\nSahasra\n‘ are not meant for restricting it to 100 or 1000 but to convey the ‘Wholeness’.\nThis verse explains the unity of all living beings.

    "commentary": "In these verses, the Knowable (Brahman) is stated vividly. ‘\nJnanagamyam\n‘ the qualities themselves are not the goal. The goal is Brahman. Whatever path is followed, Karma, Bhakti, Yoga or Dhyana, the end of the spiritual pilgrimage is Brahman. Brahma-Jnana liberates man from the horrible dream of ignorance, birth and death. Man knows the reality and that he is himself one with the Reality. The little ‘I’ did not and does not exist. So the seeker should contemplate the Knowable (Jneyam: Brahman) and realise his identity with That.\nThe idea is that with the destruction of the vasanas, one should possess the Knowledge of the Supreme.\n‘Sadhana’\nand knowledge of\n‘Sadhya’\nare both necessary. The aim of the Gita is to clear the path and also attain the goal. Man’s glorious destiny is the Realisation of Brahman.\nMay all the seekers discard all foolish and impure notions of their being flesh and blood and know themselves to be the blissful and ever-blessed Paramatma.\nasaktam:\n(drik) Atma does not touch the objective world (drisya prapancham.)\nbahirantas cha bhutanam:\nHe is both inside and outside all beings. So near He is to beings, witnessing all that they think and do, that they should never commit evil and sin in any manner what-so-ever.\nacharam charam eva cha:\nHe is moving and unmoving; How can this be? In the dream state man imagines that he is moving here and there and doing so many things. But does he really move? No. He is lying down in his bed. So also, this Universe in the form of beings is moving, and as Brahman it is unmoving. The real man, being Brahman does not move. What moves is the Drisya prapancham (Prakriti). Or it may also be interpreted that He is both the objects like animals and birds and so on, and also the unmoving like mountains and trees etc.\nsukshmatvat avijneyam:\nThere are three ethers 1. The material ether (Sthulakasa) 2. The mental ether (Chittakasa) 3. The Intelligene ether (Chidakasa). One is more subtle than the other. The third is the subtlest of all. This Chidakasa is the knowable Brahman. It is unseen by the physical eye, by the mental eye, by the eyes of the ignorant. Only the vision of knowledge reveals the Supreme.\nantike cha tat:\nHe is near, very near to the people. Knowing this they should be free from all evil and sin.\nvibhaktamiva cha:\nBrahman is undivided. He does not exist as a separate entity in the beings of the world. It would be absurd to think that each man has a separate Brahman of his own. It is the one Being who is present in all. On account of\n‘avidya’\nit appears as though He is divided. That is why the word ‘iva’ is used. In a pot of water, in the river, in the ocean, the Sun’s reflection is seen differently. But the Sun is only one. Exactly in that manner, the one Brahman, who is shining through the millions of beings, appears to be divided but is not really divided. Like the string keeping together different flowers, He exists all alone sustaining the manifold universe. Brahman being infinite there cannot be any separateness or division in Him. The aim of spiritual ‘sadhana’ is to know that one in this manifold Universe of name and form.\nBhutabhatricha, grasishnu prabhavishnu cha:\nHe is the supporter, the creator and the destroyer. He is Brahma, Vishnu and Siva.\ntamasah param:\nAll these worlds, mind and buddhi, are in the realm of ‘\navidya\n‘. This ignorance is itself darkness. The Lord is beyond the darkness of ‘avidya’ (\naditya varnam tamasah parastat 8.9\n).\njnanam, jneyam, jnanagamyam:\nThe first word (jnana) stands for knowledge. The second word (Jneyam) means Atman. The third is ‘Jnanagamyam’ – Here the word ‘jnanam’ stands for qualities like humility etc., which lead to the understanding of Brahman. Jneyam that which is to be known, the knowable (i.e.) the Supreme Brahman. This alone takes man beyond samsara. No other knowledge can achieve this liberation for mankind.\nHow then to realise God? Certainly, the answer is by the full possession of the qualities of Jnana-like amanitvam, ‘adambhitvam’ etc. There is no other way. Let the seekers be perfectly clear about this point, and strive hard to cultivate every one of the divine virtues.\nhridi sarvasya vishtitam:\nHe is in the heart of all. From worms and germs up to Brahma (Creator) the Lord is present in every being, in the moving and the unmoving. There is nothing where he is not. This being the highest truth, each one can realise Him in His own heart. Whether one looks out at the manifested universe or looks within at the Atma the same Brahman exists. There cannot be any distinction between high or low or big or small. Everyone can hope to realise Him, whoever he is and wherever he may stand in the scheme of things.\nBhagavad Gita 13.15 to 13.18 by Swami Chetanananda\nBhagavad Gita 13.15 to 13.19 by Swami Shuddhidananda\nLight of Lights by Swami Sarvapriyananda\nSri Ramakrishna Says —\nIshan intended to retire to a solitary place and practise a special discipline of the Gayatri, through which Brahman is invoked. But the Master said that the Knowledge of Brahman was not possible without the complete destruction of worldliness. Further, he said that it was impossible for a man totally to withdraw his mind from the objects of the senses in the Kaliyuga, when his life was dependent on food. That is why the Master discouraged people from attempting the Vedic worship of Brahman and asked them to worship Sakti, the Divine Mother, who is identical with Brahman.\nMASTER (to Ishan):\n“Why do you waste your time simply repeating ‘Neti, neti’? Nothing whatsoever can be specified about Brahman, except that It exists.\n“Whatever we see or think about is the manifestation of the glory of the Primordial Energy, the Primal Consciousness. Creation, preservation, and destruction, living beings and the universe, and further, meditation and the meditator, bhakti and prema — all these are manifestations of the glory of that Power.\n“But Brahman is identical with Its Power. On returning from Ceylon, Hanuman praised Rama, saying: ‘O Rama, You are the Supreme Brahman, and Sita is Your Sakti. You and She are identical.’ Brahman and Sakti are like the snake and its wriggling motion. Thinking of the snake, one must think of its wriggling motion, and thinking of its wriggling motion, one must think of the snake. Or they are like milk and its whiteness. Thinking of milk, one has to think of its colour, that is, whiteness, and thinking of the whiteness of milk, one has to think of milk itself. Or they are like water and its wetness. Thinking of water, one has to think of its wetness, and thinking of the wetness of water, one has to think of water.\n“This Primal Power, Mahamaya, has covered Brahman. As soon as the covering is withdrawn, one realises: ‘I am what I was before’, ‘I am Thou; Thou art I’.\n“As long as that covering remains, the Vedantic formula ‘I am He’, that is, man is the Supreme Brahman, does not rightly apply.\nThe wave is part of the water, but the water is not part of the wave.\n(\nBG 9.4\n) As long as that covering remains, one should call on God as Mother. Addressing God, the devotee should say, ‘Thou art the Mother and I am Thy child; Thou art the Master and I am Thy servant.’ It is good to have the attitude of the servant toward the master. From this relationship of master and servant spring up other attitudes: the attitude of serene love for God, the attitude of friend toward friend, and so forth. When the master loves his servant, he may say to him, ‘Come, sit by my side; there is no difference between you and me.’ But if the servant comes forward of his own will to sit by the master, will not the master be angry?\n“God’s play on earth as an Incarnation is the manifestation of the glory of the Chitsakti, the Divine Power. That which is Brahman is also Rama, Krishna, and Siva.”\nISHAN:\n“Yes, sir. Both Hari and Hara are derived from the same root. The difference lies only in the pratyaya.”\nMASTER:\n“Yes, there is only One without a second. The Vedas speak-of It as ‘Om Satchidananda Brahma’, the Puranas as ‘Om Satchidananda Krishna’, and the Tantra as ‘Om Satchidananda Siva’.\n“The Chitsakti, as Mahamaya, has deluded all with ignorance. It is said in the Adhyatma Ramayana that when the rishis saw Rama, they prayed to Him in these words only: ‘O Rama, please do not delude us with Your world-bewitching maya.'” (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\n—–\nA few minutes afterwards Narendra entered the room with a friend, whom he introduced to the Master as an author. Sri Ramakrishna talked with him about the metaphysical significance of Radha and Krishna. The author said that Radha and Krishna were the Supreme Brahman. Vishnu, Siva, Durga, and the other deities had sprung from them.\nMASTER:\n“That is good. There are different aspects of Radha. In Her seductive aspect She was Chandravali. In Her aspect of love She participated in Sri Krishna’s lila at Vrindavan. Nandaghosh, Krishna’s foster-father, had the vision of the Eternal Radha.\n“First is the seductive Radha, then the Radha of love. If you go farther, you will see the Eternal Radha. It is like taking off the layers of an onion one by one. First the red layers, then the pink, then the white. Afterwards you don’t find any more layers. Such is the nature of the Eternal Radha, Radha the Absolute. There the discrimination following the process of ‘Not this, not this’ comes to an end.\n“There are two aspects of Radha-Krishna: the Absolute and the Relative.\nThey are like the sun and its rays. The Absolute may be likened to the sun, and the Relative to the rays.\n“A genuine bhakta dwells sometimes on the Absolute and sometimes on the Relative. Both the Absolute and the Relative belong to one and the same Reality. It is all one — neither two nor many.”\nAUTHOR:\n“Sir, why do they speak of the ‘Krishna of Vrindavan’ and the ‘Krishna of Mathura’?”\n3\nMASTER:\n“That is the view of the goswamis. But the scholars of upper India think differently. According to these scholars there is only Krishna, and no Radha. The Krishna of Dwaraka is not associated with Radha.”\nAUTHOR:\n“Sir, Radha and Krishna are themselves the Supreme Brahman.”\nMASTER:\n“That is good.\nBut you must remember that everything is possible for God. He is formless, and again He assumes forms. He is the individual and He is the universe. He is Brahman and He is Sakti. There is no end to Him, no limit. Nothing is impossible for Him. No matter how high the kites and vultures soar, they can never strike against the ceiling of the sky. If you ask me what Brahman is like, all I can say is that It cannot be described in words. Even when one has realised Brahman, one cannot describe It. If someone asks you what ghee is like, your answer will be, ‘Ghee is like ghee.’ The only analogy for Brahman is Brahman. Nothing exists besides It.”\n(Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\nEkashloki by Adi Shankaracharya —",

It would be absurd to think that each man has a separate Brahman of his own. It is the one Being who is present in all. On account of\n‘avidya’\nit appears as though He is divided. That is why the word ‘iva’ is used. In a pot of water, in the river, in the ocean, the Sun’s reflection is seen differently. But the Sun is only one. Exactly in that manner, the one Brahman, who is shining through the millions of beings, appears to be divided but is not really divided. Like the string keeping together different flowers, He exists all alone sustaining the manifold universe. Brahman being infinite there cannot be any separateness or division in Him. The aim of spiritual ‘sadhana’ is to know that one in this manifold Universe of name and form.\nBhutabhatricha, grasishnu prabhavishnu cha:\nHe is the supporter, the creator and the destroyer. He is Brahma, Vishnu and Siva.\ntamasah param:\nAll these worlds, mind and buddhi, are in the realm of ‘\navidya\n‘. This ignorance is itself darkness. The Lord is beyond the darkness of ‘avidya’ (\naditya varnam tamasah parastat 8.9\n).\njnanam, jneyam, jnanagamyam:\nThe first word (jnana) stands for knowledge. The second word (Jneyam) means Atman. The third is ‘Jnanagamyam’ – Here the word ‘jnanam’ stands for qualities like humility etc., which lead to the understanding of Brahman. Jneyam that which is to be known, the knowable (i.e.) the Supreme Brahman. This alone takes man beyond samsara. No other knowledge can achieve this liberation for mankind.\nHow then to realise God? Certainly, the answer is by the full possession of the qualities of Jnana-like amanitvam, ‘adambhitvam’ etc. There is no other way. Let the seekers be perfectly clear about this point, and strive hard to cultivate every one of the divine virtues.\nhridi sarvasya vishtitam:\nHe is in the heart of all. From worms and germs up to Brahma (Creator) the Lord is present in every being, in the moving and the unmoving. There is nothing where he is not. This being the highest truth, each one can realise Him in His own heart. Whether one looks out at the manifested universe or looks within at the Atma the same Brahman exists. There cannot be any distinction between high or low or big or small. Everyone can hope to realise Him, whoever he is and wherever he may stand in the scheme of things.\nBhagavad Gita 13.15 to 13.18 by Swami Chetanananda\nBhagavad Gita 13.15 to 13.19 by Swami Shuddhidananda\nLight of Lights by Swami Sarvapriyananda\nSri Ramakrishna Says —\nIshan intended to retire to a solitary place and practise a special discipline of the Gayatri, through which Brahman is invoked. But the Master said that the Knowledge of Brahman was not possible without the complete destruction of worldliness. Further, he said that it was impossible for a man totally to withdraw his mind from the objects of the senses in the Kaliyuga, when his life was dependent on food. That is why the Master discouraged people from attempting the Vedic worship of Brahman and asked them to worship Sakti, the Divine Mother, who is identical with Brahman.\nMASTER (to Ishan):\n“Why do you waste your time simply repeating ‘Neti, neti’? Nothing whatsoever can be specified about Brahman, except that It exists.\n“Whatever we see or think about is the manifestation of the glory of the Primordial Energy, the Primal Consciousness. Creation, preservation, and destruction, living beings and the universe, and further, meditation and the meditator, bhakti and prema — all these are manifestations of the glory of that Power.\n“But Brahman is identical with Its Power. On returning from Ceylon, Hanuman praised Rama, saying: ‘O Rama, You are the Supreme Brahman, and Sita is Your Sakti. You and She are identical.’ Brahman and Sakti are like the snake and its wriggling motion. Thinking of the snake, one must think of its wriggling motion, and thinking of its wriggling motion, one must think of the snake. Or they are like milk and its whiteness. Thinking of milk, one has to think of its colour, that is, whiteness, and thinking of the whiteness of milk, one has to think of milk itself. Or they are like water and its wetness. Thinking of water, one has to think of its wetness, and thinking of the wetness of water, one has to think of water.\n“This Primal Power, Mahamaya, has covered Brahman. As soon as the covering is withdrawn, one realises: ‘I am what I was before’, ‘I am Thou; Thou art I’.\n“As long as that covering remains, the Vedantic formula ‘I am He’, that is, man is the Supreme Brahman, does not rightly apply.\nThe wave is part of the water, but the water is not part of the wave.\n(\nBG 9.4\n) As long as that covering remains, one should call on God as Mother. Addressing God, the devotee should say, ‘Thou art the Mother and I am Thy child; Thou art the Master and I am Thy servant.’ It is good to have the attitude of the servant toward the master. From this relationship of master and servant spring up other attitudes: the attitude of serene love for God, the attitude of friend toward friend, and so forth. When the master loves his servant, he may say to him, ‘Come, sit by my side; there is no difference between you and me.’ But if the servant comes forward of his own will to sit by the master, will not the master be angry?\n“God’s play on earth as an Incarnation is the manifestation of the glory of the Chitsakti, the Divine Power. That which is Brahman is also Rama, Krishna, and Siva.”\nISHAN:\n“Yes, sir. Both Hari and Hara are derived from the same root. The difference lies only in the pratyaya.”\nMASTER:\n“Yes, there is only One without a second. The Vedas speak-of It as ‘Om Satchidananda Brahma’, the Puranas as ‘Om Satchidananda Krishna’, and the Tantra as ‘Om Satchidananda Siva’.\n“The Chitsakti, as Mahamaya, has deluded all with ignorance. It is said in the Adhyatma Ramayana that when the rishis saw Rama, they prayed to Him in these words only: ‘O Rama, please do not delude us with Your world-bewitching maya.'” (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\n—–\nA few minutes afterwards Narendra entered the room with a friend, whom he introduced to the Master as an author. Sri Ramakrishna talked with him about the metaphysical significance of Radha and Krishna. The author said that Radha and Krishna were the Supreme Brahman. Vishnu, Siva, Durga, and the other deities had sprung from them.\nMASTER:\n“That is good. There are different aspects of Radha. In Her seductive aspect She was Chandravali. In Her aspect of love She participated in Sri Krishna’s lila at Vrindavan. Nandaghosh, Krishna’s foster-father, had the vision of the Eternal Radha.\n“First is the seductive Radha, then the Radha of love. If you go farther, you will see the Eternal Radha. It is like taking off the layers of an onion one by one. First the red layers, then the pink, then the white. Afterwards you don’t find any more layers. Such is the nature of the Eternal Radha, Radha the Absolute. There the discrimination following the process of ‘Not this, not this’ comes to an end.\n“There are two aspects of Radha-Krishna: the Absolute and the Relative.\nThey are like the sun and its rays. The Absolute may be likened to the sun, and the Relative to the rays.\n“A genuine bhakta dwells sometimes on the Absolute and sometimes on the Relative. Both the Absolute and the Relative belong to one and the same Reality. It is all one — neither two nor many.”\nAUTHOR:\n“Sir, why do they speak of the ‘Krishna of Vrindavan’ and the ‘Krishna of Mathura’?”\n3\nMASTER:\n“That is the view of the goswamis. But the scholars of upper India think differently. According to these scholars there is only Krishna, and no Radha. The Krishna of Dwaraka is not associated with Radha.”\nAUTHOR:\n“Sir, Radha and Krishna are themselves the Supreme Brahman.”\nMASTER:\n“That is good.\nBut you must remember that everything is possible for God. He is formless, and again He assumes forms. He is the individual and He is the universe. He is Brahman and He is Sakti. There is no end to Him, no limit. Nothing is impossible for Him. No matter how high the kites and vultures soar, they can never strike against the ceiling of the sky. If you ask me what Brahman is like, all I can say is that It cannot be described in words. Even when one has realised Brahman, one cannot describe It. If someone asks you what ghee is like, your answer will be, ‘Ghee is like ghee.’ The only analogy for Brahman is Brahman. Nothing exists besides It.”\n(Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\nEkashloki by Adi Shankaracharya —",

    "translation": "It shines through the functions of all the senses, and yet It is devoid of senses. It is unattached, and yet It sustains all. It is devoid of gunas, and yet It enjoys them.\nIt is without and within all beings. It is unmoving and also moving. It is incomprehensible because It is subtle. It is far away, and yet It is near.\nIt is indivisible, and yet It is, as it were, divided among beings. That Knowable Brahman is the Sustainer of all beings, and also their Devourer and Generator.\nThe Light even of lights, It is said to be beyond darkness. As knowledge, the object of knowledge, and the goal of knowledge, It is set firm in the hearts of all.",
    "commentary": "In these verses, the Knowable (Brahman) is stated vividly. ‘\nJnanagamyam\n‘ the qualities themselves are not the goal. The goal is Brahman. Whatever path is followed, Karma, Bhakti, Yoga or Dhyana, the end of the spiritual pilgrimage is Brahman. Brahma-Jnana liberates man from the horrible dream of ignorance, birth and death. Man knows the reality and that he is himself one with the Reality. The little ‘I’ did not and does not exist. So the seeker should contemplate the Knowable (Jneyam: Brahman) and realise his identity with That.\nThe idea is that with the destruction of the vasanas, one should possess the Knowledge of the Supreme.\n‘Sadhana’\nand knowledge of\n‘Sadhya’\nare both necessary. The aim of the Gita is to clear the path and also attain the goal. Man’s glorious destiny is the Realisation of Brahman.\nMay all the seekers discard all foolish and impure notions of their being flesh and blood and know themselves to be the blissful and ever-blessed Paramatma.\nasaktam:\n(drik) Atma does not touch the objective world (drisya prapancham.)\nbahirantas cha bhutanam:\nHe is both inside and outside all beings. So near He is to beings, witnessing all that they think and do, that they should never commit evil and sin in any manner what-so-ever.\nacharam charam eva cha:\nHe is moving and unmoving; How can this be? In the dream state man imagines that he is moving here and there and doing so many things. But does he really move? No. He is lying down in his bed. So also, this Universe in the form of beings is moving, and as Brahman it is unmoving. The real man, being Brahman does not move. What moves is the Drisya prapancham (Prakriti). Or it may also be interpreted that He is both the objects like animals and birds and so on, and also the unmoving like mountains and trees etc.\nsukshmatvat avijneyam:\nThere are three ethers 1. The material ether (Sthulakasa) 2. The mental ether (Chittakasa) 3. The Intelligene ether (Chidakasa). One is more subtle than the other. The third is the subtlest of all. This Chidakasa is the knowable Brahman. It is unseen by the physical eye, by the mental eye, by the eyes of the ignorant.

It is only from the flower of devotion that the fruit of knowledge grows. Therefore every seeker has to acquire God’s grace and Guru’s benediction by virtuous acts, by worship, by japa, tapas, by singing the name and glory of the Lord and by following all the aids to pure devotion. Then, out of compassion, He bestows on His Bhakta the ‘\nbuddhiyoga\n‘ which enables him to distinguish the kshetra and kshetrajna. This knowledge leads him to become one with Paramatma (\nMadbhavaya\n). One may become a great scholar of the Sastras and Sciences, but he cannot obtain knowledge of the Divine if there is no devotion. Learning and realisation are entirely different. They are poles apart. Let the seekers move forward on the path of devotion, and let them gradually gain the intellectual purity to understand the final Truth. Moksha is the fruit of perfect knowledge of the kshetra and kshetrajna. And this knowledge is offered to the true devotee by the Lord Himself.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda",

    "commentary": "Many ask the question “When did this samsara, bondage, maya, begin ?” – It would be difficult for the sleeper to say when a dream has started during sleep. This world also is of the same nature. It is beginningless. If one enters a mountain-cave full of darkness, he cannot say how long the darkness has been there. Therefore it is said that this Maya, Prakriti, is beginningless (anadi). No one can say when it began. But it has not been said that it is endless(anantam). If it is endless also, no one can cross over. Maya has no beginning, but it has an end. The moment knowledge dawns on man, it ends. The illusion is shattered, the moment Truth is seen. The dream-world may be beginningless, but the moment one wakes up it is all gone. True Knowledge then removes delusion forever. So Prakriti has no beginning but has an end; Purusha is beginningless and endless. He is eternal.\nPrakriti sambhavan:\nPurusha is ever pure (\nNityasuddha\n). There cannot be any change or modification in Him. Desire, hatred, pleasure and pain all these arise from Prakriti. As long as these passions agitate the mind, it is clear to everyone that he is subject to the power of Maya, that he is still in the realm of kshetra and has not attained the kshetrajna. These ‘vasanas,’ having come to man from endless births, should be cleared by determined effort, and he should reach the Purusha in due course. Whenever the mind is agitated by these passions, whenever the intellect becomes clouded, one should firmly assert and affirm that he is the Purusha, changeless, pure and perfect. He should keep himself alert and apart, and watch these modifications as objective changes in the outside world with which he is not at all concerned. He should remain firm and immovable like the mountain. That is the way to overcome the past ‘samskaras’; there is no other way.\nBhagavad Gita 13.20 to 13.24 by Swami Chetanananda\nBhagavad Gita 13.20 to 13.21 by Swami Shuddhidananda\nBhagavad Gita: Chapter 13 🔻 (35 Verses)\n01\n02\n03\n04\n05\n06\n07\n08\n09\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35",

The cause for it is the attachment of the Jiva with qualities (sattva, rajas and tamas) and the various objects of the material world. This is the cause of bondage though the Jiva (Purusha) is really the Drik (seer), yet he is deluded into thinking that he is the objective body, and by the delusion, he attaches himself to the objective world through a sense of ‘I’ and ‘mine’, through ‘raga’ and ‘dvesha’. Thus he becomes bound and takes birth after birth in the world. He becomes a ‘samsari’ by binding himself to ‘samsara’. Therefore the wise man should know that attachment to the Gunas is the cause of birth and all the evils arising from it. He should cut off all contact with the Gunas, and the vehicle of the body; and he should not have any feeling of ‘myness’, regarding the body and its modifications. He should positively contemplate that He is ever free, pure consciousness, till by such contemplation, he releases himself from the shackles of the body and the Gunas relating to it. He then knows what he really is the eternally pure and perfect Purusha. This is the only way to go beyond the ocean of samsara, the series of births and deaths which one suffers. Attahment is bondage, detachment is freedom.\nIn a huge factory, several small wheels rotate by the power of the fly-wheel. If the belt of the fly-wheel is snapped, the other smaller wheels stop rotating automatically. If the mainspring of a watch is cut off, all the other wheels stop moving. Thus if the contact with the body and the Gunas of Prakriti is given up completely, the whole series of births and deaths come to end, and that very moment man attains freedom and perfection.\nCommentary by Swami Shuddhidananda\nPurusha, embodied in Prakriti…..\nAshu Mitra wrote about an interesting event: “Once we printed some photos of Holy Mother (size 12″ x 15″) from the studio of a European photographer. I gave one copy to the Mother to see; she took it with both hands and then touched it with her forehead. Seeing her childlike action, I suppressed my laughter. When she returned the photo, I asked her, ‘Mother, whose photo is this?’ Like a simple girl, she replied: ‘Why? It is my picture.’ I laughed. She asked, ‘Why are you laughing?’ I replied, ‘Why did you salute it by touching it to your head?’ She also laughed and finally said,\n‘The Master also dwells in it.’\n” (Source: Sri Sarada Devi and Her Divine Play)",

He takes refuge, not in Prakriti, which causes bondage, birth, and all the ills of life, but in Atma, the Purusha, free and perfect, the blissful and the blessed.

In fact, the Lord has the qualities of knowledge, without which this supreme understanding cannot be obtained by anyone.

Just as the individual soul is encased in the living body, so is the universal Soul in the Living Prakriti [Nature] — the objective universe. Shivâ [i.e. Kâli] is embracing Shiva: this is not a fancy. This covering of the one [Soul] by the other [Nature] is analogous to the relation between an idea and the word expressing it: they are one and the same; and it is only by a mental abstraction that one can distinguish them. Thought is impossible without words. Therefore, in the beginning was the Word etc.\nThis dual aspect of the Universal Soul is eternal. So what we perceive or feel is this combination of the Eternally Formed and the Eternally Formless.\n[Source]\nSri Ramakrishna Says —\nDoctor Sarkar, who was a homeopath, gave Sri Ramakrishna two globules of medicine. He said, “I am giving you these two globules: one is Purusha and the other is Prakriti.” (\nAll laugh\n.)\nMASTER (\nsmiling\n):\n“Oh yes,\nPurusha and Prakriti are always together. Haven’t you observed pigeons? The male and female cannot live separately. Wherever Purusha is, there is Prakriti, and wherever Prakriti is, there is Purusha.”\nIt was Vijaya day. Sri Ramakrishna asked Dr. Sarkar to have some refreshments. The devotees served him with sweets.\nDOCTOR (\nwhile eating\n):\n“Now I say ‘Thank you’ for the sweets; but it is not for your teachings. Why should I give that ‘Thank you’ in words?”\nMASTER (\nsmiling\n):\n“The essential thing is to fix the mind on God and to practise meditation a little. What more shall I say? (\nPointing to the younger Naren\n) Look at him. His mind totally merges in God. Those things I was telling you —”\nDOCTOR:\n“Tell the others also.”\nMASTER:\n“No, a man should be given food according to his power of digestion. Can all understand what I told you? I cannot talk to everyone as I talked to you. Suppose a mother has bought a fish for the family. All her children have not the same power of digestion. For some she makes pilau and for others she makes stew. These latter have weak stomachs.” (\nAll laugh\n.) (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\n—–\n“Weeping, I prayed to the Mother: ‘O Mother, reveal to me what is contained in the Vedas and the Vedanta. Reveal to me what is in the Purana and the Tantra.’ One by one She has revealed all these to me.\n“Yes, She has taught me everything. Oh, how many things She has shown me! One day She showed me Siva and Sakti everywhere. Everywhere I saw the communion of Siva and Sakti. Siva and Sakti existing in all living things — men, animals, trees, plants. I saw Them in the communion of all male and female elements. (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\nSwami Turiyananda was very frank and truthful. But his candour in pointing out a person’s defects often proved painful. One day he came across this verse of the Bhagavata:\n“Realizing the universe as one in the aspect of Purusha and prakriti, never praise or blame the action of others”\n(11. 28. 1). Then he read the commentary on that verse: “If accidentally the teeth bite the tongue, hurt and cut it, do people take a piece of stone and break the teeth? No, because the teeth belong to the same person to whom the tongue belongs. Since the one Lord who is in me also resides in others, it is improper to find fault with them.” This teaching made a deep impression on Turiyananda; thereafter, he became gentler in correcting those in his charge.

Shame on those who, disregarding the visible Brahman, set their minds on other things! Here is the Brahman before you as tangible as a fruit in your hand! Can’t you see! Here — here — here is the Brahman!”\nHe spoke these words in such an inspiring way, that over all present there came the peace and insight of deep meditation. They stood like marble statues, so motionless and hushed in silence had they become! Swami Premananda, after his bath in the Ganges, was on his way to the shrine for worship. Hearing the words of his brother monk he fell into a state of ecstasy and became motionless. After a quarter of an hour the swami said to him, “Now go for worship.” Then only did Premananda regain normal consciousness. That scene was unforgettable. Everyone in the monastery was struck with amazement at the power of the beloved Leader who, with a word, could raise the minds of all present to the heights of the transcendental realm …",

    "translation": "Because he sees the Lord present alike everywhere, he does not injure Self by self, and thus he reaches the supreme state.",
    "commentary": "Samam, sarvatra, samavasthitam:\nThese three words show that the Lord is (1) equally present, (2) is in all beings (3) and is the same. The wise man who realises Atma in this way does not destroy the Self with the self. What is meant is that the ignorant man destroys the Self by identifying himself with the body. In fact, this amounts to suicide (Atmahatya). The Lord shows how the ignorant man, thinking of himself as the non-Self, is destroying his true Self. Generally, what does the common man see and think? He sees the body and the world externally, and thinks that he is the body. What happens then? The true Self is as good as having been destroyed because its existence is not known or realised. The wise man sees and realises the true Self, and so the does not care for the death of the body and the other vehicles covering the Atma. He knows that he is the immortal Self. But the ignorant not knowing this go through the wheel of suffering and death endlessly. They take birth after birth and die again and again. The brief interval of life is a horrible dream of sorrow and misery. This is the so-called life that man clings to desperately.\nTherefore the seeker should be constantly in contact with the Self, Paramatma, who exists equally in all beings. This Self is universal and exists everywhere, also in one’s own heart. This Knowledge and realisation lead the aspirant to the highest goal (Moksha). There is no state higher than freedom and perfection for any man anywhere.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda\nCommentary by Swami Shuddhidananda\nSwami Vivekananda Says —\nAy, if there is anything in the Gita that I like, it is these two verses (\nBG 13.28\n,\nBG 13.29\n), coming out strong as the very gist, the very essence, of Krishna’s teaching — “He who sees the Supreme Lord dwelling alike in all beings, the Imperishable in things that perish, he sees indeed. For seeing the Lord as the same, everywhere present, he does not destroy the Self by the Self, and thus he goes to the highest goal.” Thus there is a great opening for the Vedanta to do beneficent work both here and elsewhere. This wonderful idea of the sameness and omnipresence of the Supreme Soul has to be preached for the amelioration and elevation of the human race here as elsewhere. Wherever there is evil and wherever there is ignorance and want of knowledge, I have found out by experience that all evil comes, as our scriptures say, relying upon differences, and that all good comes from faith in equality, in the underlying sameness and oneness of things. This is the great Vedantic ideal.\n[Source]\n“Thus seeing the same Lord equally present everywhere, the sage does not injure the Self by the self, and thus reaches the highest goal.”\n[Source]\nThis is the bane of human nature, the curse upon mankind, the root of all misery — this inequality. This is the source of all bondage, physical, mental, and spiritual. “Since seeing the Lord equally existent everywhere, he injures not Self by self, and so goes to the Highest Goal.” This one saying contains, in a few words, the universal way to salvation.\n[Source]\nWhy do you fear to weep? Weep! Weeping clears the eyes and brings about intuition. Then the vision of diversity — man, animal, tree — slowly melting away, makes room for the infinite realization of Brahman everywhere and in every thing. Then “Verily, seeing the same God equally existent everywhere, he does not injure the Self by the self, and so goes to the Supreme Goal”.\n[Source]\nTherefore the absolute sameness of conditions, if that be the aim of ethics, appears to be impossible. That all men should be the same, could never be, however we might try. Men will be born differentiated; some will have more power than others; some will have natural capacities, others not; some will have perfect bodies, others not. We can never stop that. At the same time ring in our ears the wonderful words of morality proclaimed by various teachers: “Thus, seeing the same God equally present in all, the sage does not injure Self by the self, and thus reaches the highest goal. Even in this life they have conquered relative existence whose minds are firmly fixed on this sameness; for God is pure, and God is the same to all. Therefore such are said to be living in God.” We cannot deny that this is the real idea; yet at the same time comes the difficulty that the sameness as regards external forms and position can never be attained.\n[Source]\nBut yet, at the same time, even the idea of the body disappears where the mind itself becomes finer and finer, till it has almost disappeared, when all the different things that make us fear, make us weak, and bind us down to this body-life have disappeared. Then and then alone one finds out the truth of that grand old teaching. What is the teaching? “Even in this life they have conquered the round of birth and death whose minds are firm-fixed on the sameness of everything, for God is pure and the same to all, and therefore such are said to be living in God.” “Thus seeing the Lord the same everywhere, he, the sage, does not hurt the Self by the self, and so goes to the highest goal.”\n[Source]\nAdvaita and Advaita alone explains morality. Every religion preaches that the essence of all morality is to do good to others. And why? Be unselfish. And why should I? Some God has said it? He is not for me. Some texts have declared it? Let them; that is nothing to me; let them all tell it. And if they do, what is it to me? Each one for himself, and somebody take the hindermost — that is all the morality in the world, at least with many. What is the reason that I should be moral? You cannot explain it except when you come to know the truth as given in the Gita: “He who sees everyone in himself, and himself in everyone, thus seeing the same God living in all, he, the sage, no more kills the Self by the self.” Know through Advaita that whomsoever you hurt, you hurt yourself; they are all you. Whether you know it or not, through all hands you work, through all feet you move, you are the king enjoying in the palace, you are the beggar leading that miserable existence in the street; you are in the ignorant as well as in the learned, you are in the man who is weak, and you are in the strong; know this and be sympathetic. And that is why we must not hurt others. That is why I do not even care whether I have to starve, because there will be millions of mouths eating at the same time, and they are all mine. Therefore I should not care what becomes of me and mine, for the whole universe is mine, I am enjoying all the bliss at the same time; and who can kill me or the universe? Herein is morality. Here, in Advaita alone, is morality explained. The others teach it, but cannot give you its reason. Then, so far about explanation.\n[Source]\nThose who have attained sameness are said to be living in God. All hatred is killing the “Self by the self”, therefore love is the law of life.\n[Source]\nYesterday Mrs. Johnson, the lady superintendent of the women’s prison, was here. They don’t call it prison but reformatory here. It is the grandest thing I have seen in America. How the inmates are benevolently treated, how they are reformed and sent back as useful members of society; how grand, how beautiful, You must see to believe! And, oh, how my heart ached to think of what we think of the poor, the low, in India. They have no chance, no escape, no way to climb up. The poor, the low, the sinner in India have no friends, no help — they cannot rise, try however they may. They sink lower and lower every day, they feel the blows showered upon them by a cruel society, and they do not know whence the blow comes. They have forgotten that they too are men. And the result is slavery. Thoughtful people within the last few years have seen it, but unfortunately laid it at the door of the Hindu religion, and to them, the only way of bettering is by crushing this grandest religion of the world. Hear me, my friend, I have discovered the secret through the grace of the Lord. Religion is not in fault. On the other hand, your religion teaches you that every being is only your own self multiplied.(\nBG 6.29\n,\nBG 6.30\n,\nBG 6.31\n,\nBG 13.14\n,\nBG 13.28\n,\nBG 13.29\n,\nIsha Upanishad Verse 1\n,\nIsha Upanishad Verses 6&7\n) But it was the want of practical application, the want of sympathy — the want of heart. The Lord once more came to you as Buddha and taught you how to feel, how to sympathise with the poor, the miserable, the sinner, but you heard Him not. Your priests invented the horrible story that the Lord was here for deluding demons with false doctrines! True indeed, but we are the demons, not those that believed. And just as the Jews denied the Lord Jesus and are since that day wandering over the world as homeless beggars, tyrannised over by everybody, so you are bond-slaves to any nation that thinks it worth while to rule over you. Ah, tyrants! you do not know that the obverse is tyranny, and the reverse slavery. The slave and the tyrant are synonymous.\n[Source]\nSri Ramakrishna: “In this state I realise that it is the Mother alone who has become everything. I see Her everywhere. In the Kali temple I found that the Mother Herself had become everything — even the wicked, even the brother of Bhagavat Pundit.\n“Once I was about to scold Ramlal’s mother, but I had to restrain myself.

Then I should have known that thou wast here and thou wouldst not have come to this plight.” The frog replied, “O Râma, when I fall into a danger, I call on Thee, saying ‘O Râma, save me’; now that Thou Thyself art killing me, whom shall I call on?” (Source: Words of the Master by Swami Brahmananda)\n—–\nThe Lord being pleased with Prahlâda’s prayers and hymns, asked him what boon he desired. Prahlâda replied, “Lord, forgive those who oppressed me; in punishing them Thou wilt be punishing Thyself, for verily Thou abidest in every being.” (Source: Words of the Master by Swami Brahmananda)",

    "commentary": "All actions in the world in every way are being performed by Prakriti.\nThe real Self of man is actionless, non-doer, and only the witness of these changes and modifications that take place before Him. By His presence, Prakriti is empowered to act in various ways, to carry out its work according to natural laws. The man who knows the secret is really the wise man. His vision is true. The others having eyes do not see. Most people attribute action to themselves and are bound by the wheel of Karma. They say I have bad work or this good work; I am – happy or I am sorrowful; I am dull or I am intelligent and so on.’ This is ‘Ahamkara’ – a false identification of the Self with body and mind (\n3.27\n). This ruinous identification should go. Unless the truth is clearly seen and realised, man lives in the realm of ignorance (avidya) and cannot go beyond samsara. The distinct separateness between the actionless Atma and the functions of Prakriti should be realised by every spiritual aspirant.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda\nCommentary by Swami Shuddhidananda",

In that one, these things exist with the apparent distinction of name and form. What about the waves on the bosom of the ocean? Does they exist separately from the ocean? No. It is the ocean itself, but by name and form they are projected out of the ocean. No one can look upon the wave as having a separate existence apart from the ocean. There may be millions of waves and yet in reality they are ocean, they may come out of the ocean and disappear in the ocean. The ocean exists, the waves come and go. So also, in Paramatma the whole universe appears to exist. It comes out of and merges in Paramatma. He is the Reality. He who understands this mystery attains Brahma Jnana and then becomes Brahman.",

Moreover, He is devoid of the three qualities, and consequent changes and modifications. He is Imperishable. He is actionless. He does not do anything. As He is the Infinite, how can He go or come or do this or that? He is not tainted by anything. How can the awakened man have any contact with the objects of the dream-world? So, though the body, mind and buddhi are doing many things, yet Atma stands apart steeped in His own bliss, as the actionless witness of the phenomenal world.\nSarirasthah api:\nThe Lord is in the body, in everybody. He is in the secret cave of the human heart. He, this Lord of Lords, is so near us that we should seek for Him, find Him, and share His bliss and blessedness.

    "translation": "As the ākāśa that pervades all things is not stained, because of its subtlety, even so the Self dwelling in the body everywhere is not stained.",
    "commentary": "Ether is the subtlest of things in the material universe. So it is taken as an illustration to point out the all-pervasive, taintless, subtle nature of Atma. By simple comparisons to explain high philosophic truths, is the distinct feature of the Gita. It should not be misunderstood that Atma is ether. No. Like ether, it is subtle; that is what is meant by the comparison. Ether pervades the sky, the dust, the mire and so on, and yet it is not tainted because it is subtle. Similarly, Atma pervades the whole body, and yet it is not tainted or affected by the birth and death of the body nor by the pleasures and pains of the mind or by anything taking place through the different vehicles (upadhis). Moreover, though storm-clouds burst into a thunder, lightning and rain, and spread out in different colours yet the sky is not tainted by the cold winds and hail storm. So also, Atma is seated firm and unmovable in the body and whatever changes take place in the body and mind, it is not at all touched by them in any way whatsoever. The aspirant has to maintain with faith and courage, the attitude that he is the Self and not the body, that he has nothing to do with the innumarable troubles, sorrows, pleasures and pains of the body and the mind. This practice should be continued till it is finally and immovably fixed in the mind. Then the life of the aspirant would be fearless, sublime and blissful.\nSarvatravasthito dehe:\nParamatma (as declared in the previous\nverse\n) is so near our own body, that we should realise Him in our own heart by means of purity in thought, word and deed. It is clear that no distinction is made here about race, religion, sex, age, and nationality. The Supreme Truth is present in all, and will be revealed to all, if the perfect practice is undertaken. The practice is to search for the Lord within oneself by discarding the five sheaths (Pancha Kosas) with which He is covered, as pure water in a lake is covered up by moss. There is no doubt that determined seekers would find Him in the near future.\nBhagavad Gita 13.33 to 13.35 by Swami Shuddhidananda",

Just as the sun, who is the spectator of the world, illumines the whole world by his light, so also Paramatma illumines the entire kshetram body, mind and intellect. The Sun is only one. Paramatma is One. The sun – gives light. Paramatma is light. The Sun has nothing to do with good and bad nature of men and their actions in the world. Paramatma similarly is not concerned with the functions of the body, mind and intellect. He is just the witness, like the Sun. If the sun is not there, the whole world becomes lifeless and dark. So also if Paramatma is not there, the universe would crumble to pieces and disappear into darkness and death.",
