    "commentary": "Few people are eager to know the Lord, and among those who are eager to know, only a few are able to know Him in essence. Indeed, very rare are those who could know him fully and without any doubt. Three conditions are prescribed.\nHe should be attached to the Lord.\nHe should consider the Lord as His sole refuge.\nHe should practise yoga.\nThe mind is like a powerful search-light. When it is turned aside, the objective world is seen; When it is turned inwards, the Self is seen. The mind thinks only of that to which it is attached. As the ignorant man is attached to the material world, his mind rambles continuously sense objects and is satisfied with sense-pleasures. Such a man cannot know the Lord- Paramatma. The wise man, turning away from the objective world, thinks of the Reality understands the Truth, and enjoys peace and bliss. Therefore the Lord speaks of the yogi as one who is attached to the Lord and for whom the Lord is the sole refuge.\nThe yoga of Devotion and Dhyana are both aids to know the Lord and become one with Him.\nMoreover, in this verse, the doubt is cleared on how the Lord is to be known. He could be known by devotion to Him, by seeking refuge in Him, and by meditation on Him.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda\nCommentary by Swami Shuddhidananda\nSri Ramakrishna Says —\nMen shed streams of tears because sons are not born to them, others wear away their hearts in sorrow because they cannot get riches. But alas ! How many are there who sorrow and weep for not having seen God ? very few indeed ! Verily, he who seeks Him, who weeps for Him, attains Him.\nA Disciple asked his teacher, “Sir, please tell me how I can see God.” “Come with me,” said the Guru, “and I shall show you.” He took the disciple to a lake, and both of them got into the water. Suddenly the teacher pressed the disciple’s head under the water. After a few moments he released him and the disciple raised his head and stood up. The Guru asked him, “How did you feel?” The disciple said, “Oh! I thought I should die; I was panting for breath.” The teacher said, “When you feel like that for God, then you will know you haven’t long to wait for His vision.”\nTwo words in this verse are significant—\nasaṃśayam\nand\nsamagram\n. asaṃśayam means free of doubt. We can be perfectly doubtless only about one thing, and that is our own existence. When the knowledge is about the Self, no doubt is possible. It is One, non-dual and pure Consciousness. When one listens to the teaching from a perfect, authentic Master and absorbs it, the knowledge that is assimilated within will be such that no tinge of doubt will remain in him. And the knowledge will be samagram—complete, perfect. Completion or perfection is only in Consciousness, in the Chit, in the Self. Hence, only Self-knowledge can give us perfection. Any knowledge related to the world can never be perfect because it is ever-expanding in time, space and causation. It will never reach an end. Just as knowledge about objects and persons seen in a dream is illusory and can never be perfect, similarly, any knowledge about the world has no absolute reality.\nIt is fascinating to note that in the first verse of this chapter, Bhagavan has used the word samagram, which means complete, perfect. Towards the end, in\nverse 29\n, Bhagavan uses the word kṛtsnam, full. Both mean the same. There Bhagavan says that such a person realises Brahman, adhyātma and karma. This means that the secret behind everything—God, the mind and the world—is revealed to him.\n(Source:- Srimad Bhagavad Gita: Elixir of Eternal Wisdom by Sri Ramanacharanatirtha)\nRelated Articles:\nWith their intellect absorbed in That, their Self being That, established in that, they go from whence there is no return and their sins are dispelled by knowledge.

    "commentary": "Sri Krishna ended the\nsixth chapter\nby describing the supreme yogi as one who, with his inmost self abiding in Him, adores the Lord. Arjuna will now be taught the nature of the Lord Himself, who is the object of the yogi’s unwavering devotion.\nThe Lord’s love for the devotee is infinite. He wants to reveal everything to his disciple, make him understand the Supreme so that his mind shall not wander in ignorance at any time thereafter in the world. Lord Krishna teaches Arjuna the highest wisdom associated with personal and direct experience.\nThere are several arts and sciences in the world. Though a man may know many or most of them, his knowledge is not complete. Something still remains to be known. But\nif the Lord is known, not merely by speculation or argument, but by direct experience, then man feels that there is nothing else to be known in the world.\nThe Lord’s statement here agrees with the Upanishadic declaration. So the aim of the aspirant is not to know this or that or a hundred things, but to know that, knowing which the essence of all is fully realised. All search for knowledge ends here. There is nothing else to be known.\nWhen the base of the plant is watered, it is the same as watering the branches, blossoms, and fruits of the plant. We do not pour water on every leaf and flower. Even so, when the supreme Brahman is realised, all the experiences in the world are comprehended by that knowledge.\nWhen Lord Siva asked his sons Vighneswara and Kumaraswamy to go and make a circuit of the world, Kumaraswamy took the pain of flying all the way round the world, whereas Vighneswara went round Lord Siva and received the reward of circuiting the whole world as Lord Siva himself is the whole world. Even so, Brahmajnana comprehends the knowledge of everything else. Man’s lifetime is short and many are the sciences and arts, and no one can hope to know them all. The best way to know them all is to know the Divine essence immanent in all of them. What is the basic truth behind the whole of the phenomenal world? That question can be answered only by self-realisation, and not by the study of any number of sciences for any length of time. Out of compassion for his friend and disciple, Lord Krishna offers him that supreme knowledge.\nHere two words are used Jnana and Vijnana-Jnana means knowledge derived from the study of sastras. It is ‘Sabdabrahma’. Vijnana means realisation of Atma i.e. parabrahma’. Supreme peace and bliss is the reward of realisation, and not of indirect knowledge born of Sastraic learning. The Lord declares that he will teach the truth, fully and completely. Verily nothing is left out. Another interpretation of the words Jnana and Vijnana may also be given. Jnana may be understood as the quality of the Jnana, like humility etc., mentioned in the\n13th Discourse\n. Vijnana may be taken to mean Knowledge of the Supreme Brahman.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda\nCommentary by Swami Shuddhidananda\nSri Ramakrishna gives a lucid description of jñāna and vijñāna\n(The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna, 1942, New York edition, pp. 105–06):\n‘The jñāni gives up his identification with worldly things, discriminating, “not this, not this” (neti, neti). Only then can he realize Brahman. It is like reaching the roof of a house by leaving the steps behind, one by one.\n‘But the vijñāni, who is more intimately acquainted with Brahman, realizes something more. He realizes that the steps are made of the same materials as the roof: bricks, lime, and brick dust. That which is realized intuitively as Brahman, through the eliminating process of “not this, not this”, is then found to have become the universe and all its living beings. The vijñāni sees that the Reality which is nirguṇa, without attributes, is also saguṇa, with attributes.\n‘A man cannot live on the roof for a long time. He comes down again. Those who realize Brahman in samādhi come down also and find that it is Brahman that has become the universe and its living beings. In the musical scale there are the notes, sā, re, ga, ma, pa, dha, and ni; but one cannot keep one’s voice on “ni” a long time. The ego does not vanish all together. The man coming down from samādhi perceives that it is Brahman that has become the ego, the universe, and all living beings. That is known as vijñāna. ’\nSwami Vivekananda Says —\nIt is true that the Upanishads have this one theme before them:\nकस्मिन्नु भगवो विज्ञाते सर्वमिदं विज्ञातं भवति।\n— “What is that knowing which we know everything else?” In modern language, the theme of the Upanishads is to find an ultimate unity of things. Knowledge is nothing but finding unity in the midst of diversity. Every science is based upon this; all human knowledge is based upon the finding of unity in the midst of diversity; and if it is the task of small fragments of human knowledge, which we call our sciences, to find unity in the midst of a few different phenomena, the task becomes stupendous when the theme before us is to find unity in the midst of this marvellously diversified universe, where prevail unnumbered differences in name and form, in matter and spirit — each thought differing from every other thought, each form differing from every other form. Yet, to harmonise these many planes and unending Lokas, in the midst of this infinite variety to find unity, is the theme of the Upanishads. On the other hand, the old idea of Arundhati Nyâya applies. To show a man the fine star Arundhati, one takes the big and brilliant nearest to it, upon which he is asked to fix his eyes first, and then it becomes quite easy to direct his sight to Arundhati. This is the task before us, and to prove my idea I have simply to show you the Upanishads, and you will see it. Nearly every chapter begins with dualistic teaching, Upâsanâ. God is first taught as some one who is the Creator of this universe, its Preserver, and unto whom everything goes at last. He is one to be worshipped, the Ruler, the Guide of nature, external and internal, yet appearing as if He were outside of nature and external. One step further, and we find the same teacher teaching that this God is not outside of nature, but immanent in nature. And at last both ideas are discarded, and whatever is real is He; there is no difference. तत्त्वमसि श्वेतकेतो — “Shvetaketu, That thou art.” That Immanent One is at last declared to be the same that is in the human soul. Here is no Compromise; here is no fear of others’ opinions. Truth, bold truth, has been taught in bold language, and we need not fear to preach the truth in the same bold language today, and, by the grace of God, I hope at least to be one who dares to be that bold preacher.\n[Source]\nSri Ramakrishna Says —\nBANKIM:\n“I too think that we should first of all know about the different things of the world. How can we know of God without knowing something of this world? We should first learn from books.”\nMASTER:\n“That’s the one cry from all of you. But God comes first and then the creation. After attaining God you can know everything else, if it is necessary.\n“If you can somehow get yourself introduced to Jadu Mallick, then you will be able to learn, if you want to, the number of his houses and gardens and the amount of his money invested in government securities. Jadu Mallick himself will tell you all about them. But if you haven’t met him and if you are stopped by his door-keepers when you try to enter his house, then how will you get the correct information about his houses, gardens, and government securities? When you know God you know all else; but then you don’t care to know small things. The same thing is stated in the Vedas. You talk about the virtues of a person as long as you haven’t seen him, but no sooner does he appear before you than all such talk stops. You are beside yourself with joy simply to be with him. You feel overwhelmed by simply conversing with him. You don’t talk about his virtues any more.\n“First realise God, then think of the creation and other things. Valmiki was given the name of Rama to repeat as his mantra, but was told at first to repeat ‘mara’. ‘Ma’ means God and ‘ra’ the world. First God and then the world. If you know one you know all. If you put fifty zeros after a one, you have a large sum; but erase the one and nothing remains. It is the one that makes the many. First one, then many. First God, then His creatures and the world.\n“The one thing you need is to realise God. Why do you bother so much about the world, creation, ‘science’, and all that? Your business is to eat mangoes. What need have you to know how many hundreds of trees there are in the orchard, how many thousands of branches, and how many millions of leaves? You have come to the garden to eat mangoes. Go and eat them. Man is born in this world to realise God; it is not good to forget that and divert the mind to other things. You have come to eat mangoes. Eat the mangoes and be happy.”\nBANKIM:\n“Where do we get the mangoes?”\nMASTER:\n“Pray to God with a longing heart. He will surely listen to your prayer if it is sincere. Perhaps He will direct you to holy men with whom you can keep company; and that will help you on your spiritual path. Perhaps someone will tell you, ‘Do this and you will attain God.'” (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\nThe Master (Sri Ramakrishna) told me many times: “What is there in the scriptures? They are like sheets of paper with a shopping list on them. The list is useful only for checking off the items once purchased. When you have done that, the list is thrown away. So you should check your knowledge, your devotion, and consult the scriptures to see whether they agree. It is said, ‘When you have the knowledge of the Absolute, the scriptures are worth only a straw.’” The Divine Mother had shown Sri Ramakrishna what was in the scriptures, the Puranas, and the Tantric literature. So, though he was an unlettered person, he was able to lower the pride of the pandits. He used to say,\n“If you get a tiny ray of light from the Divine Mother, it makes all learning pale into insignificance.”\nSri Ramakrishna sounded like a drunkard when he talked to the Divine Mother, saying:\n“Do not give me the knowledge of Brahman, Mother! I don’t want it! I spit on it!”\nI was an extreme Vedantist at that time, and his words shocked me very much. I thought to myself: “My goodness! What can be greater than the knowledge of Brahman?”\n— Swami Turiyananda (Source: Ramakrishna as We Saw Him)\nShe and He are One\nSwami Bhaskareswarananda Maharaj told me about his meeting Holy Mother Sri Sarada Devi as a young college student. He was then known as Vipradas. “I had read the life of Sri Ramakrishna and was studying Eastern and Western philosophy in college. My mother Smt. Shantasheela Devi was a disciple of Holy Mother. Once I asked her, ‘You say that the Holy Mother and Sri Ramakrishna are one. I cannot understand it.’ When my mother tried to explain I began to argue with her. Finally, she said, ‘My son, I cannot convince you. You yourself ask this question to Holy Mother. She is staying at the Baghbazar house.’ I had not seen Holy Mother. So one day she took me with her to Baghbazar, Udbodhan house. Swami Saradanandaji was studying in the side room to the left of the entrance. He knew my mother, and so as soon as he saw her, he asked, ‘You are coming after a long time. And who is this boy?’ My mother replied, ‘Maharaj, he is my youngest son. He is very argumentative. He asks how Sri Thakur and Holy Mother are one and the same.’ So I have brought him here, so that he can ask Holy Mother herself.’ On hearing this, Saradanandaji told me to go upstairs and ask Mother.\n“I went upstairs, but could not find Holy Mother. I came down and informed Maharaj that there was nobody there except a chair covered with a white cloth. Then Maharaj answered, ‘Oh! That is Holy Mother sitting covered with a white sari!’ So, I, again went upstairs and approaching the chair saw two toes of Holy Mother’s holy feet slightly uncovered. When I offered my pranams, she asked, ‘Who are you?’ I replied that I was Shantasheela’s son. At this Holy Mother lifted her big veil and I saw her divine face! First she fed me with some refreshment, and understanding that I had come with some doubt, asked me what I wanted to ask. Promptly I asked her,\n‘Holy Mother, my mother says that you and Sri Thakur are one. Thakur passed way in 1886 and you are seen by us — giving advice and solving devotees’ difficulties. Then how is it that you and Thakur are one?’\nHoly Mother did not speak a word. Silently she pointed to the picture of Sri Ramakrishna in her shrine and then pointing to herself she raised her index finger indicated their oneness. That was enough to give me the conviction that Sri Ramakrishna and she are not separate, but are the all-pervading transcendental divinity appearing as two. When my mother came upstairs and offered her pranams, Holy Mother told her,\n‘Shanti, you have three sons, you give me this boy.’\nImmediately, my mother joyfully replied ‘I give this son to you.’\n“After this, my mother began to prepare me to become a sannyasi of Ramakrishna Order. By Holy Mother’s grace I joined Belur Math as a brahmachari in 1922, and received mantradiksha from Swami Shivanandaji.” (Similar Incident:\nAll three are one\n)\n— Swami Brahmasthananda, Adhyaksha, Nagpur Ashrama\nA man prays to God for what he loves most. A lover of wealth prays for money; a lover of name and fame prays for recognition; a lover of pleasure prays for enjoyment; a lover of aesthetics prays for beauty; a lover of the body prays for good health; a lover of knowledge prays for intellectual pursuits. Most people love God’s powers, but few love God. We do not realize that if we seek God, we will attain God as well as the wisdom and strength to handle worldly success. If, however, we seek only success and power, we may get them, but eventually they become sources of bondage.\nOnce Sri Ramakrishna asked Manindra Krishna Gupta: “What do you want?” “I want to express my ideas about the beauty of the world and human nature — that is my desire,” replied the young Manindra. “That is fine,” said Sri Ramakrishna with a smile.\n“But if you realize God, you will achieve everything.”\n(Source: They Lived with God)\nRelated Articles:\nThe Lord said: To you, free from malice and cavil, I shall declare this profoundest secret,\nknowledge with experience combined\n, which having known, you shall be freed from all evil.

Purusha, Atma, or Brahman, is the life-principle. Prakriti is the objective universe (\ndrisya\n) and Purusha is the seer (\ndrik\n). Prakriti is liable to destruction, but Purusha is eternal. Mind, reason and egoism are also included in Prakrifi along with the grosser elements. The elements are insentient and so the modifications of internal nature are also insentient. When it is known that the mind is insentient, its power and virulence are lost. It is held and controlled like any other material object. The insentient can never have power over the sentient. Those who do not know this secret come under the power of the mind and dance to its tune. So to control the mind, one should clearly distinguish between the gross and the sentient, and between that which is Jada’ and that which is ‘Chit’.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda\nBhagavad Gita 7.4 to 7.7 by Swami Shuddhidananda",

    "commentary": "The Lord now explains the ‘Para Prakriti’ the Higher Nature. It is the life-element by which the whole universe is upheld. Even this, like the ‘\napara prakriti\n‘ is under the control of the Lord, the Purusha. Let us understand the distinction between the\npara\nand\napara\nPrakriti by means of an illustration.\nThere is a pot filled with water, and the orb of the Sun is reflected in it. Here the pot and water are apara Prakriti- inferior nature, and the reflected orb of the sun shining in the water is para prakriti, Higher nature. The pot stands for the body, the water for the mind, and the reflected sun for the individual self (ego) by which man is deluded into thinking that he is a distinct and real personality. The real sun shining in the sky is Atma, Pursha, the Lord. When the pot and water are destroyed, the sun is not at all affected by it. He shines in his own pristine glory.\nSo the falling away of the body does not make any difference to Atma which is Eternal. Sankaracharya in the Viveka Chudamani explains this idea very clearly.\nThe wise man leaves the pot, water and the reflection, and looks at the real self-luminous Sun. So also the man of knowledge does not attach himself to the body, mind, and egoism, which appears as his individual self. He takes refuge in Atma which is distinct from all these three, in the same way as the Sun in the sky is absolutely separate from that which is reflected in the water.\nAll the changes pertain to the pot water and the reflection in it. The real Sun does not change. The pot may be big or small, the water pure or muddy. This does not affect the sun. So also the changes that take place in the body and mind of man does not affect Atma. The para and apara prakriti of the Lord undergoe all sorts of modification, but the Lord, Purusha, is not touched by them at all. The elements (apara prakriti) are insentient. According to the Advaitic concept, both the Prakritis are unreal. What is real is Atma. The seeker has to give up both the lower and higher Prakriti in order to reach Atma. Of course, the life element, the personality state, is superior to the gross insentient matter. But it is also a component part of nature and cannot claim the attribute of Reality. The man in a dream may be superior to the rocks and trees of the dream, but to the awakened man both the dream-man and dream world are utterly unreal. Thus we arrive at the one supreme Reality in para and apara Prakriti dwell, subject to the control of the Purusha. Knowing that the individual ego and the world are both unreal, the seeker has to take refuge in the Supreme Brahman.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda",

The Omnipotent, Omniscient Brahman is the material and efficient cause of the universe. According to the Advaitic concept, the Supreme Self is just the witness of all creation and destruction and is not affected by them.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda\nSri Ramakrishna Says —\n“Weeping, I prayed to the Mother: ‘O Mother, reveal to me what is contained in the Vedas and the Vedanta. Reveal to me what is in the Purana and the Tantra.’ One by one She has revealed all these to me.\n“Yes, She has taught me everything. Oh, how many things She has shown me! One day She showed me Siva and Sakti everywhere. Everywhere I saw the communion of Siva and Sakti. Siva and Sakti existing in all living things — men, animals, trees, plants. I saw Them in the communion of all male and female elements.

    "translation": "There is nothing higher than Myself, O Arjun.\nEverything rests in Me, as gems strung on a thread.",
    "commentary": "Where is God? How does He exist? These questions are answered in this verse. Like the string that holds together the garland of gems, the whole universe is strung on the Lord. There is no place where He is not. There is nothing what-so-ever higher than He.\nThe string holds the clusters of gems together, without which they fall off like disintegrated elements. Moreover, though the gems are of different shapes, sizes and colours, the string that holds them together is the same. Thus, different beings, races, classes, types of beings, different religions and creeds, and all things sentient and insentient are held together by the indwelling presence of the Lord. The naked eye could see only the gems and not the string behind. and So also, the eye of the common man can see only the outer form of the universe and not the unifying existence of the Lord behind.\nAny rational human being can understand the presence of the string behind the gems, though he does not see it with his naked eye. To deny the existence of the string on the ground that he cannot see is sheer ignorance. Such talk of the unwise carries no conviction, even as the denial of the existence of the sun by a blind man. It is not the naked eye but the eye of knowledge that can perceive the Lord as the eternal substratum and sustaining power behind the universe.\nHe who sees the sentient in the midst of the insentient, the eternal in the midst of the perishable, the changeless in the midst of the changing, is the wise man. It is the eye of Knowledge. The Upadhi (i.e.) the body – vehicle is insentient. But pervading the whole universe, there is the Omniscient Lord and He could be perceived only by the eye of Knowledge. The naked eye is made to see the outer form, and recognises it by its ‘\nnama\n‘ and ‘\nrupa\n‘. But when the eye of knowledge is opened by the grace of the Lord, His presence is recognised everywhere. Then will man understand that He is the final cause of the universe, that He is in everything, creating, sustaining, and destroying everything by the power of His Prakriti. He who sees the body is the ignorant man, he who sees the jiva is the partially wise; but he who sees Atma is the sage.\nLet the seeker take refuge in this thought that the Lord is in all, and that there is nothing other or higher than He. The illustration of the string of pearls is expained below:\nGems\nobjects\nString\nParamatma\nGems of different forms and colours\nthe manifold universe\nWithout the string, the gems do not hold together-without Paramatma the manifold universe cannot be sustained.\nThe naked eye cannot see the string the eye of the ignorant man cannot see the basic Reality.\nA deeper look discovers the string behind the gems – So also penetrating knowledge reveals the Lord.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda\nSwami Vivekananda Says —\nIt is the same light coming through glasses of different colours. And these little variations are necessary for purposes of adaptation. But in the heart of everything the same truth reigns. The Lord has declared to the Hindu in His incarnation as Krishna, “I am in every religion as the thread through a string of pearls.”\n[Source]\nSo it is with this universal religion, which runs through all the various religions of the world in the form of God; it must and does exist through eternity. “I am the thread that runs through all these pearls,” and each pearl is a religion or even a sect thereof. Such are the different pearls, and the Lord is the thread that runs through all of them; only the majority of mankind are entirely unconscious of it.\n[Source]\nIn the Gita we already hear the distant sound of the conflicts of sects, and the Lord comes in the middle to harmonize them all; He, the great preacher of harmony, the greatest teacher of harmony, Lord Shri Krishna. He says, “In Me they are all strung like pearls upon a thread.”\n[Source]\n[To a request of the New York World of October 1, 1893, for “a sentiment or expression regarding the significance of the great meeting” from each representative, Swamiji replied with the quotations given in the following paragraph; one quotation is from the Gita and one from Vyasa.]\n“I am He that am in every religion — like the thread that passes through a string of pearls.” “Holy, perfect and pure men are seen in all creeds, therefore they all lead to the same truth — for how can nectar be the outcome of poison?”\n[Source]\nThe idea of the cruel and ruthless Jehovah in the Old Testament has frightened many — but why? What right have they to assume that the Jehovah of the ancient Jews must represent the conventional idea of the God of the present day? At the same time, we must not forget that there will come men after us who will laugh at our ideas of religion and God in the same way that we laugh at those of the ancients. Yet, through all these various conceptions runs the golden thread of unity, and it is the purpose of the Vedanta to discover this thread. “I am the thread that runs through all these various ideas, each one of which is like a pearl,” says the Lord Krishna; and it is the duty of Vedanta to establish this connecting thread, however incongruous or disgusting may seem these ideas when judged according to the conceptions of today. These ideas, in the setting of past times, were harmonious and not more hideous than our present ideas. It is only when we try to take them out of their settings and apply to our present circumstances that the hideousness becomes obvious. For the old surroundings are dead and gone. Just as the ancient Jew has developed into the keen, modern, sharp Jew, and the ancient Aryan into the intellectual Hindu, similarly Jehovah has grown, and Devas have grown.\n[Source]",

    "translation": "I am the savour of waters, Ο son of Kunti, the radiance of the sun and moon; I am the syllable Om in all the Vedas, the sound in ether, the manliness in man.",
    "commentary": "In the previous\nverse\n, it is declared that the Lord is present in the whole universe, like the string in the garland of gems. To show this truth, the Lord takes certain objects and explains how He is present in them. He is in the form of taste in water, light in the sun and the moon, Pranava (OM) in the Vedas, and virility in men. Thus His presence is to be realised in all things. Taste and water, light and the sun, are inseparable. There is light where there is sun. We cannot conceive the sun without his light. Since it is difficult to conceive the universal presence of the Lord in the beginning, He illustrates the idea with reference to certain objects.\nHe is the syllable OM in all the Vedas. The essence of the Vedas is to be found in OM. No man can possibly study all the Vedas completely. Human life is too short for that purpose. So, if the syllable OM is understood and contemplated, man obtains the very essence of all the Vedas and fulfills his life. So repeating the syllable OM, contemplating the meaning of that sacred sound, thinking of the Lord as Pranava, man attains the highest.\nThe Lord is virility in men. Virility, strength, courage, and determination are all divine qualities. Timidity, weakness, and dullness are all unmanly qualities. We see the Lord Himself when we come across bold and courageous men, who readily sacrifice their life for a righteous cause. We see the Lord in the great sages and Rishis, who have overcome insuperable obstacles with courage and determination. The supreme manifestation of the Lord is magnificently described in the\nNinth Discourse\n. The seeker should cultivate courage, enthusiasm, strength and resolution in his spiritual life.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda\nBhagavad Gita 7.8 to 7.12 by Swami Shuddhidananda\nSri Ramakrishna Says —\nAt dusk the evening service began in the different temples. The Master was sitting on the small couch in his room, absorbed in contemplation of the Divine Mother. Several devotees also were there. M. was going to spend the night with the Master.\nA little later Sri Ramakrishna began to talk to a devotee privately, on the verandah north of his room. He said: “It is good to meditate in the small hours of the morning and at dawn. One should also meditate daily after dusk.” He instructed the devotee about meditation on the Personal God and on the Impersonal Reality.\nAfter a time he sat on the semicircular porch west of his room. It was about nine o’clock.\nMASTER:\n“Those who come here will certainly have all their doubts removed. What do you say?”\nM:\n“That is true, sir.”\nA boat was moving in the Ganges, far away from the bank. The boatman began to sing. The sound of his voice floating over the river reached the Master’s ears, and he went into a spiritual mood. The hair on his body stood on end. He said to M., “Just feel my body.” M. was greatly amazed. He thought: “The Upanishads describe Brahman as permeating the universe and the ether. Has that Brahman, as sound, touched the Master’s body?”\n(\nSvetasvatara Upanishad 1.13\n)\nAfter a time Sri Ramakrishna began to converse again.\nMASTER:\n“\nThose who come here must have been born with good tendencies.\nIsn’t that true?”\nM:\n“It is true, sir.”\nMASTER:\n“Adhar must have good tendencies.”\nM:\n“That goes without saying.”\nMASTER:\n“A guileless man easily realises God. There are two paths: the path of righteousness and the path of wickedness. One should follow the path of righteousness.”\nM:\n“That is true, sir. If a thread has a single fibre sticking out, it cannot pass through the eye of a needle.”\nMASTER:\n“If a man finds a hair in the food he is chewing, he spits out the entire morsel.” (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\n—–\nMASTER:\n“It is enough to believe that all is possible in God’s creation. Never allow the thought to cross your mind that your ideas are the only true ones, and that those of others are false. Then God will explain everything.\n“What can a man understand of God’s activities? The facets of God’s creation are infinite. I do not try to understand God’s actions at all. I have heard that everything is possible in God’s creation, and I always bear that in mind. Therefore I do not give a thought to the world, but meditate on God alone. Once Hanuman was asked, ‘What day of the lunar month is it?’ Hanuman said: ‘I don’t know anything about the day of the month, the position of the moon and stars, or any such things. I think of Rama alone.’\n“Can one ever understand the work of God? He is so near; still it is not possible for us to know Him. Balarama did not realise that Krishna was God.”\nM:\n“That is true, sir.”\nMASTER:\n“God has covered all with His maya. He doesn’t let us know anything. Maya is ‘woman and gold’. He who puts maya aside to see God, can see Him. Once, when I was explaining God’s actions to someone, God suddenly showed me the lake at Kamarpukur. I saw a man removing the green scum and drinking the water. The water was clear as crystal. God revealed to me that Satchidananda is covered by the scum of maya. He who puts the green scum aside can drink the water.\n“Let me tell you a very secret experience. Once I had entered the wood near the pine-grove, and was sitting there, when I had a vision of something like the hidden door of a chamber. I couldn’t see the inside of the chamber. I tried to bore a hole in the door with a nail-knife, but did not succeed. As I bored, the earth fell back into the hole and filled it. Then suddenly I made a very big opening.”\nUttering these words, the Master remained silent. After a time he said: “These are very profound words. I feel as if someone were pressing my mouth. … I have seen with my own eyes that God dwells even in the sexual organ. I saw Him once in the sexual intercourse of a dog and a bitch.\n“The universe is conscious on account of the Consciousness of God. Sometimes I find that this Consciousness wriggles about, as it were, even in small fish.”\nThe carriage came to the crossing at Shovabazar in Calcutta. The Master continued, saying, “Sometimes I find that the universe is saturated with the Consciousness of God, as the earth is soaked with water in the rainy season.\n“Well, I see so many visions, but I never feel vain about them.”\nM. (\nwith a smile\n):\n“That you should speak of vanity, sir!”\nMASTER:\n“Upon my word, I don’t feel vanity even in the slightest degree.”\nM:\n“There once lived a man in Greece, Socrates by name. A voice from heaven said that he was wise among men. Socrates was amazed at this revelation. He meditated on it a long time in solitude and then realised its significance. He said to his friends, ‘I alone of all people have understood that I do not know anything.’ But every man believes he is wise. In reality all are ignorant.”\nMASTER:\n“Now and then I think, ‘What is it I know that makes so many people come to me?’ Vaishnavcharan was a great pundit. He used to say to me:\n‘I can find in the scriptures all the things you talk about. But do you know why I come to you? I come to hear them from your mouth.’\n“\nM:\n“All your words tally with the scriptures. Navadvip Goswami also said that the other day at the festival at Panihati. You told us that day that by repeating the word ‘Gita’ a number of times one reverses it and it becomes ‘tagi’, which refers to renunciation. Renunciation is the essence of the\nGita\n. Navadvip Goswami supported your statement from the grammatical standpoint.”\nMASTER:\n“Have you found anyone else resembling me — any pundit or holy man?”\nM:\n“God has created you with His own hands, whereas He has made others by machine. All others He has created according to law.”\nMASTER (\nlaughing, to Ramlal and the other devotees\n):\n“Listen to what he is saying!”\nSri Ramakrishna laughed for some time, and said at last, “Really and truly I have no pride — no, not even the slightest bit.”\nM:\n“Knowledge does us good in one respect at least; it makes us feel that we do not know anything, that we are nothing.”\nMASTER:\n“Right you are! I am nothing. I am nobody.\n“Do you believe in English astronomy?”\nM:\n“It is possible to make new discoveries by applying the laws of Western astronomy. Observing the irregular movement of Uranus, the astronomers looked through their telescopes and discovered Neptune shining in the sky. They can also foretell eclipses.”\nMASTER:\n“Yes, that is so.”\nThe carriage drove on. They were approaching Adhar’s house. Sri Ramakrishna said to M., “Dwell in the truth and you will certainly realise God.”\nM:\n“You said the other day to Navadvip Goswami: ‘O God, I want Thee. Please do not delude me with Thy world-bewitching maya. I want to realise Thee.'”\nMASTER:\n“Yes, one should be able to say that from one’s innermost soul.” (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)",

    "translation": "Know Me, Ο son of Prithā, to be the Eternal Seed of all things that exist; I am the intelligence of the intelligent and the daring of the brave.",
    "commentary": "Bijam\n– The Lord declares that He is the seed, the cause of all beings. From Him, the seed, all beings have come, and unto Him they return. The tree is only another form of the seed. The life-force of the whole tree is already involved in the seed. The seed manifests its life-force in the new form of the tree. Even so, the Lord is the seed of all beings. It is He who is manifesting Himeself in different forms. The essence is He in every thing. Thus knowing the wise man transcends all separateness that appears to exist between one thing and another. Whoever he may be, to whatever caste or creed he may belong, high or low, the seed for him is God Himself. He is the cause of He is the father of all. So all beings in essence are God, for there is nothing else but He in the whole universe. He is the cause, and He is also the effect, and the effect is actually the cause in a different form. Knowing this, let no man imagine himself to be weak, neglected, forlorn and wretched. He is God Himself. By ignorance, he has misunderstood himself to be a limited body and a limited personality. Inspired by the words of the Lord let man throw away the veil of ignorance, and know himself as he really is (i.e.) the Supreme Brahman.\nThe inspiring message of Gitacharya is that He is Himself the seed and cause of all beings. He is present in all. This should give tremendous courage to all because it affirms the divine birth-right of each individual. Even the lowest would acquire Himalayan strength when he contemplates this truth. There is nothing low or wretched. The teacher of the Gita says, “I am the underlying principle behind you. It is from Me you have come.” Such words would lift up the sinking hearts of thousands of house-holders caught in the whirlpool of samsara. What if the wave is small or big? It has behind it the mighty ocean. It subsists and is sustained by the infinite ocean. So let no man consider himeself weak, mean and downtrodden. Let him contemplate the mighty ocean of purity and blessedness with which he is one, even as the ripple is one with the sea. The source of every man is not either his father or grandfather, but the supreme Paramatma.\nGenerally, the man claims his lineage from some ancient sage. The Lord here wants him to go a step higher and realise that He is the seed out of which he has grown. He is the Mulapurusha.",

    "translation": "I am the strength of the strong, free from longing and attachment. I am, Ο lord of the Bhāratas, the desire in all beings that is not contrary to dharma.",
    "commentary": "Strength is the glory of man, but it should be free from desire and passion. Strength should not be abused to satisfy sensual desires and greedy acquisition of worldly possessions. It should be expressed in doing good and benevolent acts, in the worship of the Divine, and in the pursuit of spiritual illumination. Whether it is intellectual or physical strength, if it is employed for selfish purposes to serve the lower impulses, it is wretched. In such cases, it is only demonical might, an asuric force, leading to self-destruction. The might of Ravana was impure by Kama, and it lead to his destruction and that of his people. So purity in strength, nobility in might, is what the Lord wants people to cultivate. His presence is felt in such strength.\nThe Lord is also ‘desire’ (kama) unopposed to Dharma. The desire to maintain one’s family in a good condition, to live in society without becoming a burden on others, to relieve the suffering of others – such desire, though it is kama, is the divine aspect of the Lord. There is no evil in such desire.\nThere are three distinct stages in the development of man. In the first stage, man’s desires instinctively run after sense-enjoyments and the gratification of lust and greed. In the second stage, desire becomes ennobled to the higher plane of selfless acts of service, generosity, and benevolence. It is then purified of its former evil. In the third and last stage, desires disappear from the mind when man realises the true Self. Then there are no desires, good or bad. It is true that Self realisation is not possible without giving up all desires. But man’s development is traceable from bad to good, and from good to the free state of Moksha. Here the Lord speaks of the second stage. Desires which agree with the Sastras, which do not run counter to Dharma, produce no evil effects. Gradually, man should rise to the ‘\nnirvikalpa\n‘ state of mind. Give up bad desires, and then give up all desires, and be thoroughly contented in the Self. This is the significance of the Lord’s statement here.\nBhagavad Gita: Chapter 7 🔻\n(30 Verses)\n01\n02\n03\n04\n05\n06\n07\n08\n09\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30",

    "commentary": "The Lord has already declared that He is the sustaining power behind the universe. What is sustained cannot be without the power that sustains it. So the existence of Paramatma makes the existence of everything possible. Minus Paramatma, nothing can exist. The universe as we see it with all its panoramic changes is the creative power of the Lord. In the same way as the snake in the rope is sustained by the rope itself, the Lord is the cause of the illusory universe, and just as the rope is really a rope even during the time of one’s illusion, so also the Lord is Himself of the universe whether one realises it or not. Just as the snake depends upon the rope, and the rope does not depend upon the snake, so also all beings are dependent upon the Lord, but the Lord is not dependent on them. The wave depends on the ocean, but the ocean does not depend on the wave.\nWhen the Lord says that all the qualities (sattva, rajas, tamas) are caused by Him, it is certainly not to encourage tamasic or temperments. or rajasic temperments.

Then only does he make the attempt to regain his freedom. The spiritual aspirant is on a higher plane because he has become conscious of his bondage and is eager to know the truth. This itself is a great step in evolution. The majority of people do not even know that they are slaves to their own lower nature. The aspirant is awakened to his present position as a bound soul, and so he strives to get himself free from the shackles that bind him. Except for the jivanmuktas, all the others – rich and poor, great and small, learned and illiterate – are bound by Maya. The eye cannot see objects when there is a cataract. It should be removed by surgical operation. Then the eye becomes clear and sees things distinctly. Such an operation should be conducted by the spiritual seeker. In this verse, the cause of ignorance is explained. In the next\nverse\n, the way to freedom is pointed out.\nCommentary by Swami Shuddhidananda\nSri Ramakrishna Says —\nThe Master continued:\n“Bondage and liberation are both of Her making. By Her maya worldly people become entangled in ‘woman and gold’, and again, through Her grace they attain their liberation. She is called the Saviour, and the Remover of the bondage that binds one to the world.”\nThen the Master sang the following song in his melodious voice:\nIn the world’s busy market-place, O Syama, Thou art flying kites;\nHigh up they soar on the wind of hope, held fast by maya’s string.\nTheir frames are human skeletons, their sails of the three gunas made;\nBut all their curious workmanship is merely for ornament.\nUpon the kite-strings Thou hast rubbed the manja-paste of worldliness,\nSo as to make each straining strand all the more sharp and strong.\nOut of a hundred thousand kites, at best but one or two break free;\nAnd Thou dost laugh and clap Thy hands, O Mother, watching them!\nOn favouring winds, says Ramprasad, the kites set loose will speedily\nBe borne away to the Infinite, across the sea of the world.\nThe Master said: “The Divine Mother is always playful and sportive. This universe is Her play. She is self-willed and must always have Her own way. She is full of bliss. She gives freedom to one out of a hundred thousand.”\nA BRAHMO DEVOTEE:\n“But, sir, if She likes, She can give freedom to all. Why, then, has She kept us bound to the world?”\nMASTER:\n“That is Her will. She wants to continue playing with Her created beings. In a game of hide-and-seek\n3\nthe running about soon stops if in the beginning all the players touch the ‘granny’. If all touch her, then how can the game go on? That displeases her. Her pleasure is in continuing the game. Therefore the poet said:\nOut of a hundred thousand kites, at best but one or two break free;\nAnd Thou dost laugh and clap Thy hands, O Mother, watching them!\n“It is as if the Divine Mother said to the human mind in confidence, with a sign from Her eye, ‘Go and enjoy the world.’ How can one blame the mind? The mind can disentangle itself from worldliness if, through Her grace, She makes it turn toward Herself. Only then does it become devoted to the Lotus Feet of the Divine Mother.”\n…..”I tell you the truth: there is nothing wrong in your being in the world. But you must direct your mind toward God; otherwise you will not succeed.\nDo your duty with one hand and with the other hold to God. After the duty is over, you will hold to God with both hands.\n“It is all a question of the mind. Bondage and liberation are of the mind alone. The mind will take the colour you dye it with. It is like white clothes just returned from the laundry. If you dip them in red dye, they will be red. If you dip them in blue or green, they will be blue or green. They will take only the colour you dip them in, whatever it may be. Haven’t you noticed that, if you read a little English, you at once begin to utter English words: Foot fut it wit? (The Master was merely mimicking the sound of English.) Then you put on boots and whistle a tune, and so on. It all goes together. Or, if a scholar studies Sanskrit, he will at once rattle off Sanskrit verses. If you are in bad company, then you will talk and think like your companions. On the other hand, when you are in the company of devotees, you will think and talk only of God.\n“The mind is everything. A man has his wife on one side and his daughter on the other. He shows his affection to them in different ways. But his mind is one and the same.\nBhagavad Gita: Chapter 7 🔻\n(30 Verses)\n01\n02\n03\n04\n05\n06\n07\n08\n09\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30",

    "commentary": "The jnani is declared to be the highest of the Lord’s devotees because he possesses two qualities not found in the other types. Firstly, he is constantly absorbed in the Self, and secondly, he is devoted to the Lord only and nothing else in the world.\n1.\nNitya yuktah\n– The jnani who has realised the Self is always in contact with the Lord. The others think of the Lord now and then. They are part-time devotees; they think of the Lord for some time and then go back to their daily activities of life. But the Jnani has no worldy activities to divert his mind from the Self. So he is ever united with the Lord ‘Nityayuktah’. Though in the early stages, the devotee’s mind vacillates between the Lord and worldly life, yet it is quite possible gradually to develop constant devotion and since the Jnani has achieved this, he is declared to be the best of the devotees.\n2.\nekabhaktih –\nThe Jnani is devoted only to the Lord. He has no attachment to anything else in the world. The others have desires and fears, because they are attached to the world, and think of the Lord for help and protection. The Jnani on the other hand has already found out the illusory nature of the world, and so he has no attraction for anything like wealth or family, name or glory which usually tempt the ignorant. He knows the One Supreme Reality, and his mind is absorbed in it. The Lord is dear to him, and he is dear to the Lord. The closeness of the relationship between the Lord and the devotee is indicated here. Nothing can stand in between the two. In fact, the world stands between man and God. The Jnani has removed this mighty obstacle from his way and has come so close to the Lord that he and his Master become one. When the Lord is pleased with his devotee, what more does he want? The reward of God’s love is moksha.\nIn the ultimate analysis, there can be no difference between Jnana and Bhakti. That is what is implied in the single-minded devotion of the Jnani. It is only in the early stages of Sadhana that Jnana and devotion appear to be different, but as a man rises to higher and higher spiritual planes, he discovers the truth, that the Supreme Lord of the devotee and the Brahman of the Jnani are only two different names for the same One.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda\nCommentary by Swami Shuddhidananda\nSwami Vivekananda Says —\nFour sorts of people worship Me. Some want the delights of the physical world. Some want money, some want religion. Some worship Me because they love Me. Real love is love for love’s sake. I do not ask health or money or life or salvation. Send me to a thousand hells, but let me love Thee for love’s sake. Mira Bai, the great queen, taught the doctrine of love for love’s sake.\n[Source]\nVarious sorts of worship we see in this world. The sick man is very worshipful to God. … There is the man who loses his fortune; he also prays very much, to get money. The highest worship is that of the man who loves God for God’s sake.\n[Source]\nSri Ramakrishna Says —\nJAYGOPAL:\n“How does one receive the grace of God?”\nMASTER:\n“Constantly you have to chant the name and glories of God and give up worldly thoughts as much as you can. With the greatest effort you may try to bring water into your field for your crops, but it may all leak out through holes in the ridges. Then all your efforts to bring the water by digging a canal will be futile.\n“You will feel restless for God when your heart becomes pure and your mind free from attachment to the things of the world. Then alone will your prayer reach God. A telegraph wire cannot carry messages if it has a break or some other defect.\n“I used to cry for God all alone, with a longing heart. I used to weep, ‘O God, where art Thou?’ Weeping thus, I would lose all consciousness of the world. My mind would merge in the Mahavayu.\n“How can one attain yoga? By completely renouncing attachment to worldly things. The mind must be pure and without blemish, like the telegraph wire that has no defect.\n“One must not cherish any desire whatever. The devotion of a man who has any desire is selfish. But desireless devotion is love for its own sake. You may love me or not, but I love you: this is love for its own sake.\n“The thing is that one must love God. Through intense love one attains the vision of Him. The attraction of the husband for the chaste wife, the attraction of the child for its mother, the attraction of worldly possessions for the worldly man — when a man can blend these three into one, and direct it all to God, then he gets the vision of God.” (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\n—–\n“What will a man gain by knowing many scriptures? The one thing needful is to know how to cross the river of the world. God alone is real, and all else illusory.\n“While Arjuna was aiming his arrow at the eye of the bird, Drona asked him: ‘What do you see? Do you see these kings?’ ‘No, sir’, replied Arjuna. ‘Do you see me?’ ‘No.’ ‘The tree?’ ‘No.’ ‘The bird on the tree?’ ‘No.’ ‘What do you see then?’ ‘Only the eye of the bird.’\n“He who sees only the eye of the bird can hit the mark. He alone is clever who sees that God is real and all else is illusory. What need have I of other information? Hanuman once remarked: ‘I don’t know anything about the phase of the moon or the position of the stars. I only contemplate Rama.’ (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\n“God cannot be realised if there is the slightest attachment to the things of the world. A thread cannot pass through the eye of a needle if the tiniest fibre sticks out. (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\n“Subtle are the ways of dharma. One cannot realise God if one has even the least trace of desire. A thread cannot pass through the eye of a needle if it has the smallest fibre sticking out. (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\n“The truth is that you cannot attain God if you have even a trace of desire. Subtle is the way of dharma. If you are trying to thread a needle, you will not succeed if the thread has even a slight fibre sticking out. (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)",

    "translation": "Noble indeed are they all; but the man endowed with wisdom I deem to be My very Self. For, steadfast in mind, he remains fixed in Me alone as the Supreme Goal.",
    "commentary": "It is declared here that the Jnani is verily God himself, because he considers the Lord to be the only supreme goal, and is established in Him with a steadfast mind. But the other devotees are also noble because they have faith in the Lord and worship Him sometime or other. These are certainly superior to the rest of mankind who have no faith in the Lord.\nThe knower of Brahman becomes Brahman. So is the Jnani, the Lord Himself. The others are dualistic in their attitude. They think of themselves as separate from the Lord and worship Him as a superior Being. This is quite natural in the early stages of Sadhana. When the aspirant is enthroned in yoga he knows that he is not separate from the Lord. That is why the Jnani is described as harmonised in mind, ‘yuktatma’. The Jnani knows that the Lord is his supreme goal. He has no desire and attachment for anything else. He has discovered the illusory nature of the world. And so, the Lord is the only Reality for him. With an unswerving mind, he thinks, lives, moves and has his being in the Lord. That is why the Jnani is worshipped as the Lord Himself. Vyasa is described as Vishnu Himself with two arms. Though such men dwell in a mortal body, they are verily God. Where is God to be found? The answer definitely is that –God is found in His devotee, the Jnani. Whatever path is followed – karma, bhakti, jnana or dhyana – the final goal is union with the Supreme Being. All Sadhana finds its ultimate fulfillment in the realisation of oneness with the Lord.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda\nCommentary by Swami Shuddhidananda",

    "translation": "At the end of many births the man of wisdom seeks refuge in Me, realizing that Vāsudeva is all. Rare indeed is such a high-souled person.",
    "commentary": "From time immemorial, man has passed through innumerable births. From worms and germs, reptiles, birds, and beasts, the man, at last, attain the human birth. Several births pass away in a state of ignorance. And then, the desire to know the truth is born in the heart of man. Even then, several births pass away in the ups and downs of spiritual Sadhana. Ultimately man realises the truth, that everything is God. So long as there is the slightest trace of differentiation knowledge is imperfect. Perfection of jnana is the discovery that there is only One and that is God, and there is nothing but He in the whole universe. Sages of such realisation are indeed very rare.\nBut it would be foolish to be lazy and dull in spiritual sadhana, because realisation can come only after many births. On the other hand, knowing full well that he has passed through millions of births, man should strive for liberation even in this very birth. The test of knowledge is the recognition of God everywhere. So long as the objective world ‘drisya’ dominates the mind causing contradictory feelings of attraction and repulsion, there is no knowledge. The aspirant should intensify his sadhana till he comes to know without any doubt that what has been appearing as the objective world is nothing but the Lord Himself.\nThe verse does not mean that only after many births man realises God. It means that man acquires knowledge after many births and he then realises God. That auspicious moment when such realisation takes place is the end of all births. If one makes himself fit for realisation, knowledge may dawn on him this moment. There is no time-limit. Ripeness of mind is all that is needed.\nThe Lord confers the title ‘\nmahatma\n‘ on such realised souls.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda\nCommentary by Swami Shuddhidananda\nSri Ramakrishna Says —\nMASTER:\n“God alone is the Master, and again, He is the Servant. This attitude indicates Perfect Knowledge. At first one discriminates, ‘Not this, not this’, and feels that God alone is real and all else is illusory. Afterwards the same person finds that it is God Himself who has become all this — the universe, maya, and the living beings. First negation and then affirmation. This is the view held by the Puranas. A vilwa-fruit, for instance, includes flesh, seeds, and shell. You get the flesh by discarding the shell and seeds. But if you want to know the weight of the fruit, you cannot find it if you discard the shell and seeds. Just so, one should attain Satchidananda by negating the universe and its living beings. But after the attainment of Satchidananda one finds that Satchidananda. Itself has become the universe and the living beings. It is of one substance that the flesh and the shell and seeds are made, just like butter and buttermilk.\n“It may be asked, ‘How has Satchidananda become so hard?’ This earth does indeed feel very hard to the touch. The answer is that blood and semen are thin liquids, and yet out of them comes such a big creature as man. Everything is possible for God. First of all reach the indivisible Satchidananda, and then, coming down, look at the universe. You will then find that everything is Its manifestation. It is God alone who has become everything. The world by no means exists apart from Him.\n“All elements finally merge in akasa. Again, at the time of creation, akasa evolves into mahat and mahat into ahamkara. In this way the whole world-system is evolved. It is the process of involution and evolution. A devotee of God accepts everything. He accepts the universe and its created beings as well as the indivisible Satchidananda.\n“But the yogi’s path is different. He does not come back after reaching the Paramatman, the Supreme Soul. He becomes united with It.\n“The ‘partial knower’ limits God to one object only. He thinks that God cannot exist in anything beyond that.\n“There are three classes of devotees. The lowest one says, ‘God is up there.’ That is, he points to heaven. The mediocre devotee says that God dwells in the heart as the ‘Inner Controller’. But the highest devotee says: ‘God alone has become everything. All that we perceive is so many forms of God.’ Narendra used to make fun of me and say: ‘Yes, God has become all! Then a pot is God, a cup is God!’ (\nLaughter\n.)\n“All doubts disappear when one sees God. It is one thing to hear of God, but quite a different thing to see Him. A man cannot have one hundred per cent conviction through mere hearing. But if he beholds God face to face, then he is wholly convinced. (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\n—–\nA boy named Vishnu, living in Ariadaha, had recently committed suicide by cutting his throat with a razor. The talk turned to him.\nMASTER:\n“I felt very badly when I heard of the boy’s passing away. He was a pupil in a school and he used to come here. He would often say to me that he couldn’t enjoy worldly life. He had lived with some relatives in the western provinces and at that time used to meditate in solitude, in the meadows, hills, and forests. He told me he had visions of many divine forms.\n“Perhaps this was his last birth. He must have finished most of his duties in his previous birth. The little that had been left undone was perhaps finished in this one.\n“One must admit the existence of tendencies inherited from previous births. There is a story about a man who practised the sava-sadhana. (A religious practice prescribed by the Tantra, in which the aspirant uses a sava, or corpse, as his seat for meditation.) He worshipped the Divine Mother in a deep forest. First he saw many terrible visions. Finally a tiger attacked and killed him. Another man, happening to pass and seeing the approach of the tiger, had climbed a tree. Afterwards he got down and found all the arrangements for worship at hand. He performed some purifying ceremonies and seated himself on the corpse. No sooner had he done a little japa than the Divine Mother appeared before him and said: ‘My child, I am very much pleased with you. Accept a boon from Me.’ He bowed low at the Lotus Feet of the Goddess and said: ‘May I ask You one question, Mother? I am speechless with amazement at Your action. The other man worked so hard to get the ingredients for Your worship and tried to propitiate You for such a long time, but You didn’t condescend to show him Your favour. And I, who don’t know anything of worship, who have done nothing, who have neither devotion nor knowledge nor love, and who haven’t practised any austerities, am receiving so much of Your grace.’ The Divine Mother said with a laugh;\n‘My child, you don’t remember your previous births.\n(\nBG 4.5\n) For many births you tried to propitiate Me through austerities. As a result of those austerities all these things have come to hand, and you have been blessed with My vision. Now ask Me your boon.'”\nA DEVOTEE:\n“I am frightened to hear of the suicide.”\nMASTER:\n“Suicide is a heinous sin, undoubtedly. A man who kills himself must return again and again to this world and suffer its agony.\n“But I don’t call it suicide if a person leaves his body after having the vision of God. There is no harm in giving up one’s body that way. After attaining Knowledge some people give up their bodies. After the gold image has been cast in the clay mould, you may either preserve the mould or break it. (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\nThat state is the Supreme Brahman, extremely subtle, but positively existent. Though considered a nihil(void) by gross-minded people because of the impossibility of knowing Him through the senses, He is what the Bhāgavatas call Vāsudeva. — Srimad Bhagavatam 9.9.49\nThe Absolute Truth is pure consciousness and the ultimate object of attainment. It is one, devoid of any divisions of internal and external. It is eternal and is called Brahman by the jnanis. The same Absolute Truth is called Paramatma by the yogis and is situated without any disturbance in the heart of each living entity. It is called Bhagavan by devotees. The learned scholars call Him Vasudeva. — Srimad Bhagavatam 5.12.11\nThe Supreme Truth to be sought after, is described by enlightened ones as Non-dual Consciousness. It is variously called as Brahman (by the Vedantins) as Paramatman (by the votaries of Hiranyagarbha) and as the Bhagavan (by the Bhaktas). — Srimad Bhagavatam 1.2.11\nOne day Sri Ramakrishna became a kalpataru (the wish-fulfilling tree) and fulfilled the wishes of his disciples. Some asked for devotion, some knowledge, and some liberation. Seeing Sharat silent, the Master asked him: “How would you like to realize God? What divine vision do you prefer to see in meditation?” Sharat replied: “I do not want to see any particular form of God in meditation.\nI want to see Him in all beings.\nI do not like visions.” The Master said with a smile: “\nThat is the last word in spiritual attainment.\nYou cannot have it all at once.” “But I won’t be satisfied with anything short of that,” replied Sharat.\n“I shall strive my best until I am able to attain it.”\nAt last the Master blessed him, saying, “Yes, you will attain it.”\nFrom Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna —\n[Source]\nThe conversation turned to the spiritual zeal of devotees, as illustrated in the earnestness of the gopis of Vrindavan. Ramlal sang:\nThou art my All in All, O Lord! — the Life of my life, the Essence of essence;\nIn the three worlds I have none else but Thee to call my own.\nThou art my peace, my joy, my hope; Thou my support, my • wealth, my glory;\nThou my wisdom and my strength.\nThou art my home, my place of rest; my dearest friend, my next of kin;\nMy present and my future, Thou; my heaven and my salvation.\nThou art my scriptures, my commandments; Thou art my ever gracious Guru;\nThou the Spring of my boundless bliss.\nThou art the Way, and Thou the Goal; Thou the Adorable One, O Lord!\nThou art the Mother tender-hearted; Thou the chastising Father;\nThou the Creator and Protector; Thou the Helmsman who dost steer\nMy craft across the sea of life.\nMASTER (to the devotees):\n“Ah! What a beautiful song! —\n‘Thou art my All in All.’\n”\nRamlal sang again, this time describing the pangs of the gopis on being separated from their beloved Krishna:\n1\nHold not, hold not the chariot’s wheels!\nIs it the wheels that make it move?\nThe Mover of its wheels is Krishna,\nBy whose will the worlds are moved. . . .\nThe Master went into deep samadhi. His body was motionless; he sat with folded hands as in his photograph. Tears of joy flowed from the corners of his eyes. After a long time his mind came down to the ordinary plane of consciousness. He mumbled something, of which only a word now and then could be heard by the devotees in the room. He was saying:\n“Thou art I, and I am Thou — Thou eatest — Thou — I eat! . . . What is this confusion Thou hast created?”\nContinuing, the Master said:\n“I see everything like a man with jaundiced eyes! I see Thee alone everywhere. O Krishna, Friend of the lowly! O Eternal Consort of my soul! O Govinda!”\nAs he uttered the words “Eternal Consort of my soul” and “Govinda”, the Master again went into samadhi. There was complete silence in the room. The eager and unsatiated eyes of the devotees were fixed on the Master, a God-man of infinite moods.\n—–\n“Formal worship drops away after the vision of God. It was thus that my worship in the temple came to an end. I used to worship the Deity in the Kali temple. It was suddenly revealed to me that everything is Pure Spirit. The utensils of worship, the altar, the door-frame—all Pure Spirit. Men, animals, and other living beings — all Pure Spirit. Then like a madman I began to shower flowers in all directions. Whatever I saw I worshipped.\n“One day, while worshipping Siva, I was about to offer a bel-leaf on the head of the image, when it was revealed to me that this Virat, this Universe, itself is Siva. After that my worship of Siva through the image came to an end. Another day I had been plucking flowers, when it was revealed to me that the flowering plants were so many bouquets.” (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\nFor many years they lived in Dehu, and\nBahinabai\ngave birth to her daughter Kashibai and later to her son Vithoba. After Sant Tukaram’s physical disappearance in 1650, the family shifted to Shirur where she died at the age of 72 in 1700. On her deathbed, she composed a very unique set of abhangs, where she describes her twelve previous births to her son Vithoba. She says that during all these births she was a spiritual seeker and asserts that the present birth would be her last. (Source:\nBahinabai\n)\nEvery place is Durga, every being is Durga, every woman, man and animal is Durga. Whatever we see are all Durga. There is nothing other than Durga. (This Mantra is Chanted during Durga Worship in Belur Math)\nONCE, a bird sat on the mast of a ship. When the ship sailed through the mouth of the Ganges into the ‘black waters’ of the ocean, the bird failed to notice the fact. When it finally became aware of the ocean, it left the mast and flew north in search of land. But it found no limit to the water and so returned. After resting a while it flew south. There too it found no limit to the water. Panting for breath the bird returned to the mast. Again, after resting a while, it flew east and then west. Finding no limit to the water in any direction, at last it settled down on the mast of the ship. (Source:\nTales and Parables of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\nThere was an ascetic, who worshipped God Ganesā. He had an idol of Ganesā, and another one of a rat, both made of gold. Both of theseweighed equally. Once the ascetic decided to go on a pilgrimage, He went to a goldsmith to sell them. The goldsmith weighed them and told the ascetic, that the value of each of the two was the same. At this the ascetic grew angry with the goldsmith and asked him how a vehicle could be equal, in value to the Lord. The goldsmith replied. “Sir, I am not buying either God Ganesā, or his vehicle, the rat. I buy gold. So I shall pay you according to their weight” ‘Thus, as a goldsmith does not notice Lord Ganesā or his vehicle, he sees only gold. So does a great soul behold God, he does not, see the world.

He is present in all these different Devas. So when man worships them with faith, his faith is made unswerving by the Lord Himself. The point to note is that if there is faith in some form or other, such faith is strengthened by the Lord.\nThis is the unique feature of the Hindu concept of God. Each man is free to worship the Divine in any form. There is no restriction or compulsion in the choice of the object of worship. The path may be different. Whatever path one may follow, he has to come ultimately to the One Supreme Being. Since this universal vision is hard to acquire, men are given infinite choice to worship any form which appeals to their imagination, according to their past samskaras. The only condition is that there should be faith in the worship. Progress should be maintained whether the pace is slow or quick. And also, the destination should be kept in view, and there should be no deviation or back-sliding. Such men are blessed by the Lord with increased faith and stronger devotion to their respective Gods. So it is man’s duty to start worship of his chosen Deity. Faith and devotion are conferred on him by the Lord Himself.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda\nBhagavad Gita 7.21 to 7.23 by Swami Shuddhidananda\nRelated Articles:\nO Arjuna!

(\n10.42\n)\nIn Jayrambati on the morning of 8 June 1913, Surendranath Bhaumik and Dr. Durgapada Ghosh came to the Mother and bowed down to her. They had been visiting and were to take their leave that afternoon. She blessed them by placing her hands on their heads and then she asked them to take their seats. After a brief conversation, Surendra said to the Mother: “Mother, while worshipping the Master I find one difficulty. Suppose a devotee has a general belief that his Ishta-Devi [the chosen goddess] and the Master are one and the same. He worships the Ishta-Devi through the image of the Master. Afterwards he surrenders the fruits of his japa to the image of the Master, uttering the words, ‘O Maheshwari [the supreme goddess], through thy grace,’ and so forth. This creates confusion in my mind.”\nHoly Mother said with a smile: “Don’t worry, my child.\nOur Master alone is Maheshwara [the supreme god] as well as Maheshwari. He alone is the embodiment of all the deities. He alone is the embodiment of all mystic syllables. Through him one can worship all gods and goddesses. You can address him as Maheshwara as well as Maheshwari.\n” (Source: Sri Sarada Devi and Her Divine Play)\nSri Ramakrishna Says —\n(\nTo Ram and the other devotees\n) “If you asked me which form of God you should meditate upon, I should say:\nFix your attention on that form which appeals to you most; but know for certain that all forms are the forms of one God alone.\n“\nNever harbour malice toward anyone. Siva, Kali, and Hari are but different forms of that One. He is blessed indeed who has known all as one.\n(Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\nOne should not condemn any method practised by a person who genuinely believes in his heart of hearts that it will enable him to realize God. The spiritual attitude of no one should be interfered with. For, if one rightly grasps any attitude, through it alone one can realize the divine Lord, who is the embodiment of all attitudes. Stick to your own attitude and continue calling on Him. But never condemn anybody’s attitude nor try to make another’s attitude your own.\n(Source: Sri Ramakrishna The Great Master)\n—–\nThe Master (Sri Ramakrishna) established relationships with devotees according to their natures. The Master established a particular spiritual relationship with each devotee based on that person’s inner nature. He used to say, “I see vividly what is inside human beings, as one sees the items in a glass case.” A person can never act contrary to his or her nature, so the devotees were incapable of acting in a way inconsistent with the relationship adopted by the Master. If a man imitated another person, going against his own nature by doing so, the Master would be displeased and would point out that man’s mistake. For example, he used to call Girish “Bhairava” [a form of Shiva]. One day at the Dakshineswar Kali temple when he was in ecstasy, he saw Girish in that form. He put up with Girish’s importunities and harsh words because he could see the wonderful tenderness and complete dependence hidden under the veil of his rough mannerisms. Once another devotee of the Master used that kind of rude language towards him, imitating Girish. The Master was very displeased and later pointed out his error.\nThe Master guided devotees individually along their respective spiritual paths. Established in bhavamukha, the Master had full knowledge of the innate spiritual mood of each man and woman devotee and established a permanent loving relationship with each of them accordingly.

He who seeks a small pond when the sacred Ganges is flowing by, he who leaves the wish – fulfilling plant of Heaven and goes to a small tree, tempted by its half-sweet half- bitter fruits – such is the man who forgets the Supreme Lord and devotes himself to the worship of the lesser Deities for the purpose of enjoying small gifts and pleasures.\nHigh or low, whatever is seen (drisya) perishes, be he Indra or Vasu.

    "translation": "Not knowing My supreme Nature, immutable and transcendent, foolish men think that I, the Unmanifest, am endowed with a manifest form.",
    "commentary": "The Lord is really formless and universal. He is transcendental, beyond Maya, infinite and eternal. For the purpose of protecting the righteous and punishing the wicked, and establishing Dharma, He takes birth in this world. As Maya is under His control the power of adopting or discarding His form is in His own power.\nWhen the Lord thus incarnates Himself as a separate individual, His immortality is not at all affected. The separate form as Krishna or Rama is His own creation, and when the purpose of His Avatara is fulfilled, the form is dissolved and He remains the Eternal. The devotees are blessed by such Avataras. But unfortunately, the ignorant men of little intelligence consider the name and form of the Lord as His real nature, and so, they do not find Him different from other mortals. No doubt the devotees are endowed with faith and devotion when they see the manifestation of the Lord as Rama or Krishna. But they should Know the higher nature (Parambhavam) of the Lord, and should not get confused.\nFour attributes are mentioned about the higher nature of the Lord. (1) He is unknowable (\nAvykta\n). (2) He is transcendental (\nparam\n). (3) He is imperishable (\nAvyayam\n). (4) He is supreme (\nAnúttamam\n). He is unknowable by the senses and the mind. The phenomenal world is visible to the senses and comprehensible by the mind. If the Lord also is a composition of the elements, he would dissolve like any other mortal form. But he is imperishable. He is subtler than any other. The material sky (\nAkasa\n) is itself invisible and so how can the Lord whose nature is more subtle (\nChidakasa\n) be an object of perception? He is the whole universe, but he is at the same time not bound by physical laws because He is transcendental. Since He is beyond time and place, and is uncontaminated by material elements, since He is not subject to dissolution like other things, He is described as Supreme, most excellent (Anuttama).\nIt should be clearly understood that this verse is not a disparagement of the worship of the different manifestations of the Lord in temples and images. The common devotee must go through this process of fixing some form of the Lord in the mind and worshipping Him in that manner. But he should not stop there. As his vision enlarges and his devotion deepens, he will naturally evolve towards the transcendental perfection of the Lord. Devotion of this type is commendable.\nWhat is condemned here is to attribute mortality to the Lord and regard Him to be no more than a man. Sisupala could see Lord Krishna as a cowherd-boy and nothing more. It was Bhishma who could understand the transcendental nature of the Lord, while he appeared in the beautiful form of Krishna. Bhishma could worship the Lord as Krishna, and at the same time know that He is the imperishable Paramatma. Ravana could think of Sri Rama only as a mortal, subject to death like any other. But sages like Vasishta and others could understand that Sri Rama is the Lord Himself appearing as the Prince of Ayodhya. It is this understanding which is suggested in the verse for the guidance of all seekers. (\nVerse 6.4\n)\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda\nBhagavad Gita 7.24 to 7.25 by Swami Shuddhidananda\nSri Ramakrishna Says —\nMASTER (\nreferring to the brahmani and her relatives\n):\n“Ah! How happy they were!”\nM:\n“How amazing! A similar thing happened with two women at the time of Jesus. They too were sisters, and devoted to Christ. Martha and Mary.”\nMASTER (\neagerly\n):\n“Tell me the story.”\nM:\n“Jesus Christ, like you, went to their house with His devotees. At the sight of Him one of the sisters was filled with ecstatic happiness. It reminds me of a song about Gauranga:\nMy two eyes sank in the sea of Gora’s heavenly beauty\nAnd did not come back to me again;\nDown went my mind, as well, forgetting how to swim.\n“The other sister, all by herself, was arranging the food to entertain Jesus. She complained to the Master, saying: ‘Lord, please judge for Yourself — how wrong my sister is! She is sitting in Your room and I am doing all these things by myself.’ Jesus said: ‘Your sister indeed is blessed. She has developed the only thing needful in human life: love of God.'”\nMASTER:\n“Well, after seeing all this, what do you feel?”\nM:\n“I feel that Christ, Chaitanyadeva, and yourself — all three are one and the same. It is the same Person that has become all these three.”\nMASTER:\n“Yes, yes! One! One! It is indeed one. Don’t you see that it is He alone who dwells here in this way.”\nAs he said this, Sri Ramakrishna pointed with his finger to his own body.\nM:\n“You explained clearly, the other day, how God incarnates Himself on earth.”\nMASTER:\n“Tell me what I said.”\nM:\n“You told us to imagine a field extending to the horizon and beyond. It extends without any obstruction; but we cannot see it on account of a wall in front of us. In that wall there is a round hole.

Through you can be seen everything — that Infinite Meadow without any end.”\nSri Ramakrishna was very much pleased. Patting M.’s back, he said: “I see you have understood that. That’s fine!”\nM:\n“It is indeed difficult to understand that. One cannot quite grasp how God, Perfect Brahman that He is, can dwell in that small body.”\nThe Master quoted from a song:\nOh, no one at all has found out who He is;\nLike a madman from door to door He roams,\nLike a poor beggar He roams from door to door.\nM:\n“You also told us about Jesus.”\nMASTER:\n“What did I say?”\nM:\n“You went into samadhi at the sight of Jesus Christ’s picture in Jadu Mallick’s garden house.

    "commentary": "If God is Omnipresent, why does He not manifest to all. This question is frequently asked by many. The answer is here. He is veiled by his own power (Sakti), the cosmic illusion, and so He is not seen by all. To those for whom the veil is drawn off by intense discrimination, He becomes visible. Between man and God, there is the veil of cosmic illusion. It is Maya composed of the three qualities (Sattva, Rajas and Tamas). The veil of ‘Tamas’ is dark, that of Rajas is red, and that of Sattva is pure white. Thus the threefold veil covers up the effulgent Paramatma. As the devotee tears away veil after veil by intense sadhana, the Reality behind manifests itself as the final Truth.\nAll the spiritual practices are intended to remove the obstruction that stands between man and God, and not to produce or create God! He is already there, the eternal conscious principle in all.\nThe problem simply is to clear off the veil of Maya. The power of maya and how to cross over it has already been declared by the Lord (6-14).\nWhen a dark pot is placed over the lamp, light is not seen. When the pot is taken off, the light is visible. When one covers his eyes with his hands, he cannot see the Sun. When he takes off its hands, he sees the Sun. Therefore, though the Lord is present in all, He is not seen: It is true to say that what one sees as the objective world is also the Lord, but such is the power of the cosmic illusion that he is confused and thinks of the world only as matter and nothing more. When the mind is cleared of the illusion he sees everything as the Lord. (\nVasudevas sarvamiti\n).\nThe ignorant are strengthening maya and forging strong shackles to bind themselves. Lust and sensuality, indulgence in sense-pleasures, greed and hatred – these are haunting the mind of humanity, and purity and self-control are at a discount. The unrest in the world is due to the clouded intelligence of men who are not able to understand the secret of peace and blessedness. Spiritual life and inner freedom have practically become impossible for many because the atmosphere in which people live is poisoned with sense attractions and distracting elements. Blessed are the few who, in the midst of this uproar and agitation, have set their aim on perfection, and strive for it with discrimination and dispassion. They shall see the higher nature of the Lord.\nThe word ‘\nsarvasya\n‘ (to all) here should refer only to the ignorant. That the Lord is veiled by maya is from the dualistic point only. Paramatma has no veil by which He is covered. He is unclouded pure Supreme Intelligence. The veil is for the individual Jiva only. The clouds cannot at any time affect the sun. He is always bright and glorious. The covering of the clouds is from the viewpoint of those who are below the clouds. The same is the case with the Supreme Lord.\nA different interpretation of the phrase “\nYogamaya-samavritah\n” (Veiled by Yoga Maya) is given by some commentators. It is taken as a qualifying adjective to\n‘mudhah’\n(the deluded). Then the meaning would be the ignorant world veiled by the deluding power of Maya is not able to see the eternal nature of the Lord.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda\nSri Ramakrishna Says —\n“God talked to me. It was not merely His vision. Yes, He talked to me. Under the banyan-tree I saw Him coming from the Ganges. Then we laughed so much! By way of playing with me He cracked my fingers. Then He talked. Yes, He talked to me.\n“For three days I wept continously. And He revealed to me what is in the Vedas, the Puranas, the Tantras, and the other scriptures.\n“One day He showed me the maya of Mahamaya. A small light inside a room began to grow, and at last it enveloped the whole universe.\n“Further, He revealed to me a huge reservoir of water covered with green scum. The wind moved a little of the scum and immediately the water became visible; but in the twinkling of an eye, scum from all sides came dancing in and again covered the water. He revealed to me that the water was like Satchidananda, and the scum like maya.\nOn account of maya, Satchidananda is not seen. Though now and then one may get a glimpse of It, again maya covers It.\n(Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)",

    "translation": "O Arjuna! I know the past, present, and the future of all beings, but Me no one knows.",
    "commentary": "The Omniscience of the Lord is here declared. All beings are in the womb of time, and time as the cosmic illusion, is in the Lord. As the whole universe from creation to dissolution is functioning in the Lord, there is nothing that He does not know. His eye is on all beings, past, present, and future. Knowing this, how can man commit sin?\nBy contrast with the Omniscience of the Supreme Iswara, we understand the limited character of the individual Jiva. He is controlled by time. He is subject to death and change. He does not know the past or the future. His understanding is limited to very small things around him. Whereas the Lord is ‘Sarvajna’ (omniscient) the individual Jiva is ‘Kinchijna’ (of little knowledge).\nThe Lord is eternal, beyond time, all-knowing. What is man after all in the presence of the Lord? And yet this little man is proud of his strength, position, wealth, beauty and knowledge. He thinks that he is everything and thus has no thought of the Lord. This is the illusory power of Maya working on the human mind. He who knows the truth sings the infinite glory of the Lord with a hundred tongues. He prostrates himself before the Lord with deep faith and devotion. When a common mortal exhibits some ray of genius, people honour him and pay homage to him. That being so, what is the homage that man should pay to the Omniscient Lord with all His infinite power. It is the primary duty of man to contemplate the transcendental glory of the Lord, His omniscience, omnipotence, and His imperishable nature. Pride and egoism cannot have any place in the heart of the spiritual aspirant.\nMam tu veda na Kaschana\n– No one knows me. This should refer to men of demonical nature who have no faith in the Lord, who have no Self-knowledge and who are devoid of devotion. It is true that the Lord alone knows His full glory. The rest, the highest of his devotees, men of perfect knowledge, are one with Him. Standing at the screened window of his high palace, the King can see the crowds below, but not one of the crowd can see the King in the palace. So also, the Lord knows all beings, but very few know Him. Therefore it is the duty of man to understand his limitations and the unlimited power of the Lord, to have faith in Him, and to cross the ocean of samsara by His grace. As the raindrop merges in the ocean, so should the individual self merge in Him. This is Moksha, perfect freedom. Till then like the animal bound to the tether, man’s life is limited by a thousand restricting influences.\nmāṃ tu veda na kaścana\n— no one knows Me. These words have a deep spiritual implication. ‘Knowing’ happens when the mind flows out through the senses and meets the other. Such knowing is impossible in the case of Existence, one’s own Self. The only way to know the Lord is to be the Lord; that is, you cease to exist as a person; only He exists. That is the way of God-Realisation. Sri Ramana Maharshi says, “To be the Self is to see the Self. There are no two Selves, one to see the other. That is Ātmanishṭhā—abidance in the Self.”\nआत्मसंस्थितिः स्वात्मदर्शनम्।\nआत्मनिर्द्वयादात्मनिष्ठता॥ Upa.Sa. 26\nWhen one beholds the world too as God—seeing everything as Vāsudeva—it is not seeing in the usual sense. No beholding and no seeing happens there. There is no holding on to anything at all because there is no working of the intellect there. There is no thought process, because the moment the whole world becomes the Atman—ātmaiva abhūt—the thinking process comes to a halt. A kind of spontaneity alone exists, just like the natural spontaneity with which the right hand goes to help an itchy left hand. The whole world is you. You experience it as Existence. The Upanishad says,* “No one can know Me because I am the Knower. No one can see Me because I am the Seer.” You cannot see the Seer; you cannot know the Knower; you can just be.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda\nSri Ramakrishna Says —\nThe Master was still in the ecstatic mood. Suddenly he said to M: “Look here, you have had enough of reasoning. No more of it. Promise that you won’t reason any more.”\nM. (\nwith folded hands\n):\n“Yes, sir. I won’t.”\nMASTER:\n“You have had enough of it. When you came to me the first time, I told you your spiritual Ideal. I know everything about you, do I not?”\nM. (\nwith folded hands\n)\n: “Yes, sir.”\nMASTER:\n“Yes,\nI know everything: what your Ideal is, who you are, your inside and outside, the events of your past lives, and your future.\nDo I not?”\nM. (\nwith folded hands\n):\n“Yes, sir.”\nMASTER:\n“I scolded you on learning that you had a son. Now go home and live there. Let them know that you belong to them. But you must remember in your heart of hearts that you do not belong to them nor they to you.” (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\nRelated Articles:\nThe Blessed Lord said: O Arjuna! Many births of Mine have passed as well as yours. I know them all but you know them not. (\nBG 4.5\n)",

    "translation": "O Arjuna! By the delusion of pairs of opposites caused by desire and aversion, all beings are subject to illusion in the world.",
    "commentary": "All people are enveloped in ignorance from the time of birth. The Lord’s Yogamaya casts her veil around the new-born baby in the cradle. It is deep and impenetrable darkness that shrouds the human being, preventing him from seeing the light of Atma. What is this delusion? It is the delusion of the pairs of opposites like pleasure and pain, heat and cold, etc., arising from desire and aversion. Freedom from attraction and revulsion (raga and dvesha) will eliminate the pairs of opposites.\nWhen there is no desire to enjoy a particular object, there cannot be any pain resulting from the non-possession of that object, nor the hatred against those who stand in the way of such enjoyment.\nDesire agitates the mind and makes it restless, and a restless mind is far away from peace which is the only condition for Self-realisation. Even if the desire is fulfiled, the desire itself will not die with its gratification. It seeks more and more enjoyment and there is no end to desires. So this subtle and powerful enemy should be fought with discrimination and dispassion and rooted out of the mind.\nDislike towards an unpleasant object is common to all. The mind constantly fluctuates between likes and dislikes. When a pleasing thing comes to a person he is happy, but soon after when something unpleasant occurs, he is pained. Thus the whole world is divided into two opposite extremes for the common man. So long as there is pleasure, there will be pain also. So long as there is joy there shall be unhappiness also. After very long experience, man discovers that he cannot have the one without the other, and his search for a painless pleasure is the fool’s search for the hare’s horn which does not exist. Then will he seek for that joy which is self-existent, which is the very Self of men. There he finds a bliss which is uncontaminated; there finds the light that has no shadow; there he finds the peace which nothing can disturb. This state must come to all sooner or later.\nThe cosmic illusion overtakes man even from the time of birth. As man grows, the illusion takes a stronger hold on him. It is true that in childhood, desire and aversion are less powerful and so spiritual sadhana should start even from childhood, before the mind is poisoned by worldy desires, ambitions, enjoyments and so on. All great Mahatmas have practised spiritual discipline from their childhood when the mind is not positively attached to worldly things.\nArjuna is addressed as the ‘scorcher of enemies’ for he has destroyed many of the powerful enemies, and so he should strive hard to root out the invisible foes who had taken possession of his heart.\nAll beings are under delusion at birth, but some awakened souls transcend the illusion by devotion and knowledge.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda\nCommentary by Swami Shuddhidananda",

    "translation": "But those men of good works whose sin has come to an end, worship Me steadfast in vows, freed from the delusive pairs of opposites.",
    "commentary": "Only the man who is steadfast in his vows can worship the Lord and understand His higher nature. Vows of silence, fasting, celibacy, study and others are practised by many for self-perfection. But to acquire steadfast discipline is difficult. The reason is that the mind is impure by accumulated sins of several births. This is the chief obstacle in spiritual life. As the dirty cloth cannot be dyed, as no seed grows in the wasteland, so also spiritual illumination does not arise in the heart of the sinful man. Sin is the manifestation of ‘rajo guna’ and this does not allow a man to remain still in the contemplation of the Self. The Mind is turned outward to wander in the wildness of the world.\nSo the mind should be washed pure. And this is possible by performing good deeds, ‘\nDo Punya karma and destroy sin\n‘-that is the Lord’s command. The seeker should do good deeds continuously. Some charity, some service to suffering-humanity, some self-sacrifice for the sake of others, some japa and some kind of spiritual discipline should be done by him. This is the only way to eliminate sin.\nIt is foolish to say that even good karma binds. Bad can be removed only by good, and in the final stages of Realisation, both bad and good are left behind.\nBut even after Realisation the Lord has ordained that good works should be continued for the sake of setting an example for humanity. The man of good deeds shall never fall to a low state says the Lord.\nThose who have destroyed sin by good deeds, are freed from the delusive pairs of opposites, and worship the Lord with unswerving devotion. Thus they realise the Self and attain Moksha.\nVows firmly held and practised with a resolute spirit are necessary for progress. A weak and, vacillating mind cannot achieve anything. The obstruction of Maya cannot be easily removed. The Sadhaka should fix the discipline and follow it. “I will not touch food till I complete some Japa, and read a chapter of the Gita of Ramayana or some other sacred work.” Thus he should determine and act.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda\nCommentary by Swami Shuddhidananda",

    "translation": "Those who take shelter in Me, striving for liberation from old-age and death, come to know the Brahman, the individual self, and the entire field of karmic action.",
    "commentary": "The individual strives for liberation from the ills and sorrows of life and for obtaining that bliss which is perfect. All spiritual practices and surrender to the Lord, have this freedom and perfection as the goal. As the seeker continues his practice, and as his sadhana becomes ripe, (i.e.) as he becomes a Yogarudhah, he will discover that all things, all knowledge, and all action to be Brahman, and that there is nothing else but that. They see the whole life and universe as the Self, Atma, or Brahman.\nThe knowledge of Brahman does not come to all. Those who are awakened to the ills of life, who seek liberation, who strive for it, who take refuge in the Lord, they alone understand the highest Truth-that the Self is Brahman and everything is only that and nothing else. Man realises that his limited self is only a fiction, a myth and mirage, and what exists is only Brahman, and he is that (\nAham Brahmasmi\n).\nAsritya, yatani:\nThese two are the key-words of the verse. They go together, striving for liberation and surrendering to the Lord. Both these are necessary for Brahma-Jnana. When man strives for knowledge, God’s grace helps him to know the right path and reach the goal.\nBhagavad Gita 7.29 to 7.30 by Swami Shuddhidananda",

    "translation": "Those who know Me as the One that underlies all the elements, as the One that underlies all the gods, and as the One that sustains all the sacrifices, will, with steadfast mind, know Me even in the hour of death.",
    "commentary": "When the seeker attains Brahmajnana, he understands that everything pertaining to the elements, the Gods, and the sacrifices, is all comprehended by Brahman. He retains that experience even at the time of death. All indeed is Brahman and the Self is Brahman. Such knowledge is acquired through a whole life-time of sadhana, and that experience ‘I am Brahman’ is remembered at the moment of death also. If one fills the mind with worldly thoughts, those very thoughts occur at the time of death. If he is merged in the highest realisation, that memory will be powerful at the time of the dissolution of the body.\nThat is why it is declared here that the man of self-control ‘\nYuktachetasa\n‘ alone can retain that knowledge at the time of death. It does not mean that the memory of the Lord should be held only at the last moment. When man is healthy and strong, when the body is fresh and vigorous, all spiritual sadhana should be done and realisation attained. It is only then that the memory of the blissful experience remains fresh in the mind even at the last moments. As the moment of death is unknown, it follows that spiritual life should be completed when the body is in a fit condition. The Lord gives no concession to the idlers and the negligent. Besides this, the responsibility is placed fully on the personal effort of man for self-realisation. Otherwise, man is likely to live in a fool’s paradise, that some great experience would come to him of its own accord. Every seeker should understand clearly that his own effort will bring down God’s grace to help him towards final realisation.\nThe terms Adhibhuta, Adhidaiva and Adhiyajna are explained in the\nnext Discourse\n.\nBhagavad Gita Chapter 7 Summary by Swami Shuddhidananda\nBhagavad Gita: Chapter 7 🔻\n(30 Verses)\n01\n02\n03\n04\n05\n06\n07\n08\n09\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30",
