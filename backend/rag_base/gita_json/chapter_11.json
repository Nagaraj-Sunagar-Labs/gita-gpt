    "translation": "Arjuna said: Out of compassion for me You have spoken words of ultimate profundity concerning the Self, and they have dispelled my delusion.",
    "commentary": "Arjuna says that his delusion is gone by hearing the divine exposition of the Highest, by the Lord Himself. Arjuna was thinking, “These are my relations; how can I kill them?” This kind of body identification is gone. The Gita-teaching continues. But the fundamental Truth of the immortality of the Self has already been declared. And the all-pervading universality of the Lord has also been declared in definite terms. Arjuna is lifted out of the mire of delusion and despondency.\nHe speaks of the Lord’s teaching as ‘\nParamam\n‘ the highest and the best, and as ‘\nGuhyam\n‘ the greatest secret, knowing which all delusion ceases.\nThe speaker is Lord Krishna and the hearer is Arjuna. What wonder that the Lord’s medicine works on his deluded patient and cures him even before the course of treatment is completed! The effect of the Lord’s teaching is immediately felt by the disciple. Most of the people are in the same position as Arjuna, deluded and beset with doubts. If they adopt the same attitude as Arjuna-“\nSishyaste ham sādhi mām tvām prapannam\n“-there is absolutely no doubt that the Lord works on them with the same affection and compassion as he did in the case of Arjuna. What is needed is faith in the Lord. Arjuna had that faith, and so he declared that the teaching was given to him (madanugrahāya) by the compassion of the Guru towards his disciple. Those who have faith hope to have the same revelation as Arjuna had by the grace of the Lord. Krishna Paramatma is Jagadguru, and the Gita is the teaching for all mankind. Whoever believes himself to be a true disciple receives the teaching directly from Krishna Himself. Therefore let all people win the Lord’s grace by total and un-conditional self-surrender to Him.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda\nRelated Articles:\nArjuna said: My delusion is destroyed, I have regained my memory through your grace, ‘O Krishna! I stand firm, free from doubt; I will act according to your word. (\nBG 18.73\n)\n(O Krishna!) My mind is distracted by the taint of pity and I am ignorant of what my duty is, and so, I ask you to teach me what is good for me. I am your disciple. I take refuge in you. (\nBG 2.7\n)\nHaving abandoned all duties (Dharmas) take refuge in Me alone. I will liberate you from all sins. Do not grieve. (\nBG 18.66\n)",

    "commentary": "What we know here is the humility of Arjuna in appealing to the Lord to show His Cosmic Form, if it is possible for him to see it. Is he fit for it? Is he fit for seeing the vision? He did not demand it as a right, in the manner of a person who claims it as a reward of his devotion. Such humility is needed for every disciple in the presence of the Guru. He should leave it to the teacher to give him any experience which he thinks fit for the disciple. The disciple does not know what he is, what his powers are, and what he is fit for. The teacher knows it. So Arjuna appeals to the Lord to show him the Cosmic Form if the Lord thinks that he is fit to see it. Moreover, in the previous\nverse\n, Arjuna has declared his complete faith in the words of the Lord. He believes every word of the Lord when He described His infinite Glory. So faith and humility are the only means to win the Lord’s Grace.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda\nBhagavad Gita: Chapter 11 🔻\n(55 Verses)\n01\n02\n03\n04\n05\n06\n07\n08\n09\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55",

    "commentary": "In the\nVibhuti Yoga\n, the Lord declared that the whole universe exists as a fragment of His Glory (\nekamsena sthito jagat\n). So here, the Lord asks Arjuna to behold the whole universe standing like one of the limbs in the body. One can only imagine the infinity of the Lord. Nay, it is beyond all imagination, to whatever extent it may be stretched by human effort. Physical space is indeed unimaginably large; larger should be the mindspace; larger still should be ‘Chidākāśa’. In this infinity (Atma) the whole universe (Jagat) is like a spot.\nThe Lord of infinite forms, all-pervading, all-powerful, is no other than Paramatma who is the ruler of all the worlds (Sarva loka mahesvaram). Knowing Him as such, it is man’s duty to worship Him with faith, devotion, and humility. Verily, there is no cause for man to feel proud of his little wealth or power or position. What are man’s wealth and powers? What is man after all in the scheme of this universe? What after all is this earth where man glorifies himself by building a small state or empire? Man’s egoism and pride for his so-called achievements is sheer delusion (Avidya). What is small appears great; what is not appears to be the reality; what is death-struck appears immortal. This ignorance, the mother of pride and arrogance, will vanish as man truly contemplates the might of Isvara and His infinite Glory. Let the seeker be filled with adoration to the Lord, infinite and wonderful. Let his humility purify his heart. Let egotism vanish into nothing and then the Lord comes to dwell in the heart of the meek and the humble. Then comes true devotion (Para bhakti).\nBhagavad Gita: Chapter 11 🔻\n(55 Verses)\n01\n02\n03\n04\n05\n06\n07\n08\n09\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55",

    "translation": "But with these eyes of yours you cannot see Me. I give you a divine eye; behold, now, My sovereign yoga-power.",
    "commentary": "The eye of flesh can only see material things. Even physical ether is invisible to the naked eye. The limitations of the human eye and the gross delusions to which it is subject every moment, it within the experience of every thoughtful man. That the human eye is grossly erroneous in its perceptions can be seen from very simple facts. Sitting in the railway carriage, the eye sees the objects around moving with terrific speed. It sees the stationery sun crossing the sky from east to west. It sees the moon running behind the rushing clouds. All these show that the naked eye cannot be trusted to give us a correct picture of anything in the world. In fact, the eye is the most powerful cause of delusion for man. So, the Lord here says that Arjuna cannot see the Cosmic-Form by himself with his own eyes.\n“\nDrisyate tvagraya buddhya sukshamaya sukshmadarsibhih.\n” Paramatma is seen by the subtle concentrated intellect of the Seers. So say the Upanishads. Though the Lord is everywhere, man is not able to see Him because ignorance covers the eye. This is the evil of Māyā; this is the darkness or ignorance. When the covering film is taken away, the eye of knowledge sees the Truth, and delusion vanishes.\nAs the blind man cannot see the sun, so also the eye of the ignorant cannot see the all-pervading Self. It is utter nonsense to say that God does not exist because He is not seen by the eye of flesh. The argument would be as convincing as the blind man’s denial of the existence of the sun.\nHow then can man attain the divine eye to see the Lord? Assuredly, by the grace of the Lord, by His love, by His compassion. “\nDadami te chakshuh\n“, says the Lord (I give to you the divine eye). To whom does he give the divine eye? To those who are devoted to Him. (\nTesham satatayuktanam dadami buddhiyogam 10.10\n). The same idea is emphasised here. Repeatedly does the Lord inculcate the idea of surrender to Him in a spirit of devotion and humility. “Worship Me,” He says, “in every possible way; take refuge in Me; surrender to Me; I will give you knowledge, peace and bliss”. Arjuna had surrendered to the Lord, and so he has qualified himself to see the Cosmic-From, and the Lord bestows on him the divine eye for that purpose.\nThe divine eye comes to all without distinction of caste, creed, religion, or nationality. If it does not open, it is one’s own fault. “Knock and it shall be opened.” The knocking must be there. Relentless perseverance is needed. Such spiritual thirst for the Divine bears fruition in the Lord’s grace descending on man. Let everyone follow the footsteps of Arjuna and obtain the Lord’s grace.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda\nSri Ramakrishna Says —\nM:\n“When one sees God does one see Him with these eyes?”\nSri Ramakrishna:\n“\nGod cannot be seen with these physical eyes.\nIn the course of spiritual discipline one gets a ‘love body’, endowed with ‘love eves’, ‘love ears’, and so on. One sees God with those ‘love eyes’. One hears the voice of God with those ‘love ears’. One even gets a sexual organ made of love.”\nAt these words M. burst out laughing. The Master continued, unannoyed, “With this ‘love body’ the soul communes with God.” (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\n—–\n“Parvati was born as the daughter of King Himalaya. After Her birth She revealed to the king Her various divine forms. The father said: ‘Well, Daughter, You have shown me all these forms. That is nice. But You have another aspect, which is Brahman. Please show me that.’ ‘Father,’ replied Parvati,\n‘if you seek the Knowledge of Brahman, then renounce the world and live in the company of holy men.’\nBut King Himalaya insisted.\nThereupon Parvati revealed Her Brahman-form, and immediately the king fell down unconscious.\n(Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\n—–\nMASTER (to Ram and the other devotees):\n“Devotees like Rakhal, Narendra, and Bhavanath may be called nityasiddha. Their spiritual consciousness has been awake since their very birth. They assume human bodies only to impart spiritual illumination to others.\n“There is another class of devotees, known as kripasiddha, that is to say, those on whom the grace of God descends all of a sudden and who at once attain His vision and Knowledge. Such people may be likened to a room that has been dark a thousand years, which, when a lamp is brought into it, becomes light immediately, not little by little.\n“Those who lead a householder’s life should practise spiritual discipline; they should pray eagerly to God in solitude. (To Mr. Choudhury) God cannot be realised through scholarship. Who, indeed, can understand the things of the Spirit through reason? No, all should strive for devotion to the Lotus Feet of God.\n“Infinite are the glories of God! How little can you fathom them! Can you ever find out the meaning of God’s ways?\n“Bhishma was none other than one of the eight Vasus, but even he shed tears on his bed of arrows. He said: ‘How astonishing! God Himself is the companion of the Pandava brothers, and still there is no end to their troubles and sorrows!’ Who can ever understand the ways of God?\n“A man thinks, ‘I have practised a little prayer and austerity; so I have gained a victory over others.’ But victory and defeat lie with God. I have seen a prostitute dying in the Ganges and retaining consciousness\n1\nto the end.”\nMR. CHOUDHURY:\n“How can one see God?”\nMASTER:\n“Not with these eyes. God gives one divine eyes; and only then can one behold Him. God gave Arjuna divine eves so that he might see His Universal Form. (An allusion to\nthe eleventh chapter of the Bhagavad Gita\n).\n“Your philosophy is mere speculation. It only reasons. God cannot be realised that way. (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\n—–\nPREACHER:\n“Sir, I compare the formless God to the electric current, which is not seen with the eyes but can be felt.”\nMASTER:\n“Yes, both are true. God with form is as real as God without form. Do you know what describing God as being formless only is like? It is like a man’s playing only a monotone on his flute, though it has seven holes. But on the same instrument another man plays different melodies. Likewise, in how many ways the believers in a Personal God enjoy Him! They enjoy Him through many different attitudes: the serene attitude, the attitude of a servant, a friend, a mother, a husband, or a lover.\n“You see, the thing is somehow or other to get into the Lake of the Nectar of Immortality. Suppose one person gets into It by propitiating the Deity with hymns and worship, and you are pushed into It. The result will be the same. Both of you will certainly become immortal.\n“I give the Brahmos the illustration of water and ice. Satchidananda is like an endless expanse of water. The water of the great ocean in cold regions freezes into blocks of ice. Similarly, through the cooling influence of divine love, Satchidananda assumes forms for the sake of the bhaktas. The rishis had the vision of the supersensuous Spirit-form and talked with It.\nBut devotees acquire a ‘love body’, and with its help they see the Spirit-form of the Absolute\n(\nBG 11.8\n). (\nMundaka Upanishad 2.2.11\n)\n“It is also said in the Vedas that Brahman is beyond mind and words. The heat of the sun of Knowledge melts the ice-like form of the Personal God. On attaining the Knowledge of Brahman and communing with It in nirvikalpa samadhi, one realises Brahman, the Infinite, without form or shape and beyond mind and words. (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\nIt is by God’s grace alone, not self effort, that human beings can have the vision of God. In the Gita, Krishna told Arjuna: “You cannot see Me with these eyes, so I give you a divine eye.” Then only could Arjuna behold Krishna’s cosmic form.\n—\nSri Sarada Devi\n(Source:\nSri Sarada Devi and Her Divine Play\n)",

    "commentary": "Ma vyadhisthah:\n“Do not fear”. This again is the Mahamantra of the Gita, – a single word into which the essence of the Gita is distilled.\nFearlessness, courage, spirit of action, these are taught in the Gita as the main doctrines of life.\nHaving surrendered everything to the Lord, having understood that He is the real actor in this wonderful drama of life, why should man fear, when he is working as a mere instrument in the hands of God? Self-surrender and righteous action cannot have the seeds of fear in them. Therefore the Lord exhorts Arjuna to carry out his duty without any fear. In daily life, man is caught in fearful circumstances, and confronted with formidable obstacles. Everyone knows this. In such moments, if the Lord’s exhortation is remembered, man is inspired with a higher power which will enable him to overcome all the obstacles in the way. No one should give up his duty out of fear. “\nYudhyasva\n” (fight) that is what the Lord wants everyone to do, according to his status in life. The duties of life are prescribed for all, and each man has to perform them without fear or cowardice. The word ‘\njetasi\n‘ (you shall conquer) declares victory as the fruit of action. Thus, if a man surrenders himself to the Lord, and fights the battle of life righteously, he is sure to obtain victory. Where Sri Krishna is, there is victory.\nThough Bhishma and others are still alive, the Lord declares them to be ‘already dead’ (\nhatah\n). What does this mean? In the\n26th and 27th verses\n, the secret has been revealed. The Lord is Time, not time as we see it divided into past, present and future, but Eternity in which there cannot be any of these divisions manufactured by the limited mind of man. The past, present and future are one in Eternal Time. So the future of man is easily foreseeable by the divine vision. So the enemy warriors are dead already, killed by the Lord, in the Cosmic aspect of Time. Man should learn a great lesson from this. He will find that what he is considering worthy and pleasant, all the relations and friends, all the treasures and loves and hatreds, are already dead and gone, though appearing to live. Death then loses its power over the wise man who regards everything as entering the blazing mouths of the Cosmic Form. The worlds are also dead and gone. Why then this clinging to a little bit of flesh? Why then weep and wail for the loss of this or that? Time takes away all. Nay, it is all taken away already. Thus knowing, the wise man is not deluded. Renunciation (Vairagya) comes to him spontaneously. Lord Buddha thought of this inevitable sequence of human life, and was inspired to find out that, which does not die in the midst of death? That question comes to all at one time or other. The answer also comes in due course. The Self of man is man beyond death. Realising the Self-Atma, man is freed from the shadow of death. He acquires immortality in the world.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda\nBhagavad Gita: Chapter 11 🔻\n(55 Verses)\n01\n02\n03\n04\n05\n06\n07\n08\n09\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55",

What is man before the Divine! Man’s attempt to know God’s power is just like an ant’s attempt to fathom the depth of the ocean!\nMan can use a fan for a whiff of breeze; God can cause a tempest! Man can light a lamp to illumine a room, God can send forth the Sun to illumine the earth and sky! Man can dig a well for water, God can plunge the world in a deluge, making miles around vast sheets of water! Man can shoot a rocket into space! God can shoot stars and planets into space. What is man’s power before God’s! The rational man knows that he is nothing before God. His ego vanishes that very moment, and he prostrates himself before God, as Arjuna did in this situation. It is only the blind, little-minded, deluded men who boast of their power and position. Man grows and evolves, as his eyes are cleared of the cataract. He realises gradually the Infinity in which he is placed – Infinity before and behind; Infinity in the past and future; Infinity everywhere! The little human being discovers the Infinite, he becomes the Infinite; contemplating the Divine, he becomes the Divine, Delusion vanishes, Man realises the Self.\nThe devotee sees the Lord everywhere, manifesting His inscrutable and mysterious power in a miraculous manner. He bows before Him, prostrates himself before Him, offers his adoration and worship, and thus thinking of the Lord he attains the Supreme.",

    "commentary": "The Lord has already declared that He is the Father, Mother, Grandsire, of the universe. Arjuna understands the truth now, and worhships the Lord as Father and Guru. He is the highest Guru, the Guru of Gurus, the Universal Master (Jagadguru). The Lord is the only reality, and all else is ‘asat’ non-existing illusion. This being so, how can there be anything equal or greater than the Lord? He is the final refuge for all beings.\nSri Ramakrishna Says —\nMASTER:\n“Say to God with a guileless heart, ‘O God, reveal Thyself to me.’ And weep. Pray to God, ‘O God, keep my mind away from “woman and gold”.’ And dive deep. Can a man get pearls by floating or swimming on the surface? He must dive deep.\n“One must get instruction from a guru. Once a man was looking for a stone image of Siva. Someone said to him: “Go to a certain river. There you will find a tree. Near it is a whirlpool. Dive into the water there, and you will find the image of Siva.’ So I say that one must get instruction from a teacher.”\nISHAN:\n“That is true, sir.”\nMASTER:\n“It is Satchidananda that comes to us in the form of the guru. If a man is initiated by a human guru, he will not achieve anything if he regards his guru as a mere man. The guru should be regarded as the direct manifestation of God. Only then can the disciple have faith in the mantra given by the guru. Once a man has faith he achieves all. The sudra Ekalavya learnt archery in the forest before a clay image of Drona. He worshipped the image as the living Drona; that by itself enabled him to attain mastery in archery.\n“Don’t mix intimately with brahmin pundits. Their only concern is to earn money. I have seen brahmin priests reciting the Chandi while performing in the swastyayana. It is hard to tell whether they are reading the sacred book or something else. They turn half the pages without reading them. (All laugh.)\n“A nail-knife suffices to kill oneself. One needs sword and shield to kill others. That is the purpose of the sastras.\n“One doesn’t really need to study the different scriptures. If one has no discrimination, one doesn’t achieve anything through mere scholarship, even though one studies all the six systems of philosophy. Call on God, crying to Him secretly in solitude. He will give all that you need.”\n(Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)",

    "commentary": "A question arises in this verse. When Arjuna says, “\ntenaiva rupena chaturbhujena\n,” it is implied that he has seen this delightful form before? If so, when did he see this form? It appears from his imploring the Lord to forgive him for any word or act of disrespect to Him, that he has not formerly realised the Divinity of the Lord, but regarded him as a friend and relation. This contradiction can be reconciled in the following way.\n(1) Before the Lord revealed His Cosmic-Form, He should have shown the four-armed form of Vishnu. In the\n50th verse\n, it is said that the Lord appeared again in His normal form, (\nbhuyah svakam rupam\ndarsyamasa\n), and also that the Lord appeared in His gentle form (\npunah saumyavapur mahatma\n). Thus we come to know that the Lord had shown the four-armed form of Vishnu just before he assumed the Visvarupa.\n(2) Arjuna might have heard that when the Lord was born to Devaki, He appeared in the form of Vishnu with Discus, Conch and Crown etc.\n3) By seeing the Cosmic-Form, Arjuna realises that he is no other than the Supreme Lord Vishnu who rules Viakunta in His delightful form.\nBhagavad Gita: Chapter 11 🔻\n(55 Verses)\n01\n02\n03\n04\n05\n06\n07\n08\n09\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55",

Good in themselves, these practices like Vedic study, charity, etc., do not yield the highest reward of God-realisation without devotion (Bhakti).\nLatu’s (\nSwami Adbhutananda\n) lack of formal education made him unique among Sri Ramakrishna’s direct disciples. Perhaps because his mind was uncluttered by intellectualism and not trained to doubt, he absorbed the instructions of his guru with unquestioning simplicity. Once the Master told him in an ecstatic mood,\n“One day the gems of the Vedas and Vedanta will pour forth from your lips.”\nThus Latu was commissioned and blessed by his teacher. This prophecy later came to be fulfilled to the letter.\nIt would seem as though Sri Ramakrishna intended to demonstrate to the modern world through Latu that God can be realized without the study of books and scriptures, that spiritual wisdom comes not through intellectualism but through inner realization.\n(Source: God Lived With Them)\nSwami Turiyananda: “It is no use reading the scriptures unless you practise what they say. The Books have been there from time immemorial! During our wanderings in the Kangra valley, Mahârâj (Swami Brahmananda), and myself-I was then about twenty-six years old-met a monk aged about forty two, very sincere and unsophisticat-ed. He said, ‘I have been studying Vedanta for the last sixteen years. But even now the sight of a woman relaxes my self-control, just as the thought of tamarind makes the mouth water!’ He was quite right. What is there in a Book?\n“Vedanta as prevalent in some parts of the country is of a loose sort. ‘I am Brahman’, they say, and go on doing all sorts of things as if these did not affect them. Discrimination, according to them, is not a sign of knowledge. Even the womankind hold this view. And sometimes vile things are done in the name of Vedanta.\n“You know the story of a monk who came to live in the Panchavati at Dakshineswar. Gossip went round about his character, and it reached at last the ears of the Master. And when he remonstrated with him, the monk said, ‘If the world is unreal, are my slips of character alone real?’ Shri Ramakrishna replied, ‘I spit upon such knowledge as thine!’ Falsehood should never be allowed to flourish.\n“The common man takes to those activities which tend to perpetuate the bond of attachment. And this is true of the whole world. The only exceptions are the monks, who have found out the evanescence of the world and renounced it. Knowledge dawns when discrimination is perfect.” (Source: Spiritual Talks by the First Disciples of Sri Ramakrishna)\nRelated Articles:\nThis Atman is not attained through scriptural teaching and studies, not by a powerful intellect which can delve deep into the meaning of the Scriptures, and not even by listening to many teachers.

    "translation": "But by devotion to Me alone may I be known in this form, Ο Arjuna, realized truly, and entered into, Ο dreaded prince.",
    "commentary": "In the\nprevious verse\n, it was stated that God-realisation is not possible by Vedic study, sacrifices etc. In this verse, it is explained what makes union with God possible for man. This verse is therefore very important for all seekers. They should understand the full significance of the idea and realise it in practice.\nIt is here declared categorically that by single-minded devotion only the Lord could be known, seen, and attained. Ananya bhakti’ is emphasised in several places in the Gita. The mind should not be attached to anything in the objective world; it should be centred in the Lord as the sole refuge, as the most beloved and as the highest goal. Devotion that is not shared, that is not tempted away from God, that does not desire anything other than God, is single-minded devotion. Man’s mind is generally possessed by worldly things and only a part of it is offered to the Lord. This is not ‘ananya bhakti’. When the mind is not distracted by anything material, it acquires divine power and thus attains the Lord.\nThree stages of God-realisation are mentioned here: (1) Jnatum to be known, (2) drashtum to be seen, (3) praveshtum-to be entered into. In the beginning, man acquires knowledge of the nature of the Lord. Even this is difficult, because it requires deep study and correct understanding of the Sastras. At this stage, the Lord, though his nature is understood, is quite far away. This is Dwaita. Then in the next stage, the devotee is able to see the Lord face to face, have a clear vision of God in whatever form he contemplates Him. Now there is no doubt at all about His existence, because he has directly seen the Deity. The second step is higher than the first. God is seen like a leaf or fruit in one’s own hand. This is nearly the state of Visishtadvaita.\nAfter long and arduous practice the devotee becomes united with the Lord (Praveshtum). Like salt in water, like rain drops in the ocean, like water in milk, the devotee is merged in the Lord. Then there are no two entities, the devotee and the Lord. The Lord alone is. This is the highest stage. This is perfect Advaita. The aspirant should not stop anywhere till this highest goal is reached. The first is the nearness of God (\nsamipya\n), the second is the vision of the God (\nsarupya\n) and the third is union with God (\nsayujya\n). The natural progress of man towards God is explained thus in this verse. -Every aspirant should move forward from the first to the second and from the second to the last and ultimate state. It is for this reason that the Lord has stated ‘\nJnatum\n‘ first, and ‘\ndrashtum\n‘ next, and ‘\nPraveshtum\n‘ last.\nSuppose somebody tells us that he has seen a good and beautiful, highly relishing fruit in the market. What is our reaction? We are interested to go and see the fruit and then to buy it and eat it. At first we have come to know of the fruit (Jnatum) and next we go and see it (drashtum), and finally we are fully satisfied by tasting the fruit for ourselves (Praveshtum). The last is the state of the Jivanmukta, the liberated man. It is Moksha. We come to know of a house, see it, and then enter it. Thus one should approach God and realise Him. Everybody should attain the highest Advaitic realisation even in this very life. Then only he is free from the bondage of ‘samsara’.\nThe Upanishad says\nYada hyevaisha etasminnudara mantaram\nkurute atha tasya bhayam bhavati.\nEven the slightest separation from the Lord causes fear. When there is fear of anything, it is not perfection. So every aspirant should strive to attain the Lord (Praveshtum) and free himself from fear.\nIf Vedic study alone could lead to God-realisation, the illiterate shall have to go without it. If austerity alone should lead to God-realisation the weak shall have no hope; If ‘yajnas’ and ‘Dana’ alone could lead to God, the poor shall have to be where they are. As it is declared by the Lord that by single-minded devotion alone he could be realised, every human being can aspire for God-realisation by pure and uncontaminated devotion. Thus out of His compassion, the Lord has revealed the easy path of God-realisation to all beings.\nSri Ramakrishna Says —\nBRAHMO DEVOTEE:\n“What are the means by which one can see God?”\nMASTER:\n“Can you weep for Him with intense longing of heart? Men shed a jugful of tears for the sake of their children, for their wives, or for money. But who weeps for God? So long as the child remains engrossed with its toys, the mother looks after her cooking and other household duties. But when the child no longer relishes the toys, it throws them aside and yells for its mother. Then the mother takes the rice-pot down from the hearth, runs in haste, and takes the child in her arms.”\nBRAHMO DEVOTEE:\n“Sir, why are there so many different opinions about the nature of God? Some say that God has form, while others say that He is formless. Again, those who speak of God with form tell us about His different forms. Why all this controversy?”\nMASTER:\n“A devotee thinks of God as he sees Him. In reality there is no confusion about God. God explains all this to the devotee if the devotee only realises Him somehow. You haven’t set your foot in that direction. How can you expect to know all about God?\n“Listen to a story. Once a man entered a wood and saw a small animal on a tree. He came back and told another man that he had seen a creature of a beautiful red colour on a certain tree. The second man replied: ‘When I went into the wood, I also saw that animal. But why do you call it red? It is green.’ Another man who was present contradicted them both and insisted that it was yellow. Presently others arrived and contended that it was grey, violet, blue, and so forth and so on. At last they started quarrelling among themselves. To settle the dispute they all went to the tree. They saw a man sitting under it. On being asked, he replied: ‘Yes, I live under this tree and I know the animal very well. All your descriptions are true. Sometimes it appears red, sometimes yellow, and at other times blue, violet, grey, and so forth. It is a chameleon. And sometimes it has no colour at all. Now it has a colour, and now it has none.’\n“In like manner, one who constantly thinks of God can know His real nature; he alone knows that God reveals Himself to seekers in various forms and aspects. God has attributes; then again He has none. Only the man who lives under the tree knows that the chameleon can appear in various colours, and he knows, further, that the animal at times has no colour at all. It is the others who suffer from the agony of futile argument.\n“Kabir used to say, The formless Absolute is my Father, and God with form is my Mother.’\n“God reveals Himself in the form which His devotee loves most. His love for the devotee knows no bounds. It is written in the Purana that God assumed the form of Rama for His heroic devotee, Hanuman.\n“The forms and aspects of God disappear when one discriminates in accordance with the Vedanta philosophy. The ultimate conclusion of such discrimination is that Brahman alone is real and this world of names and forms illusory.\nIt is possible for a man to see the forms of God, or to think of Him as a Person, only so long as he is conscious that he is a devotee.\nFrom the standpoint of discrimination this ‘ego of a devotee’ keeps him a little away from God.\n“Do you know why images of Krishna or Kali are three and a half cubits high? Because of distance. Again, on account of distance the sun appears to be small. But if you go near it you will find the sun so big that you won’t be able to comprehend it. Why have images of Krishna and Kali a dark-blue colour? That too is on account of distance, like the water of a lake, which appears green, blue, or black from a distance. Go near, take the water in the palm of your hand, and you will find that it has no colour. The sky also appears blue from a distance. Go near and you will see that it has no colour at all.\n“Therefore I say that in the light of Vedantic reasoning Brahman has no attributes. The real nature of Brahman cannot be described. But so long as your individuality is real, the world also is real, and equally real are the different forms of God and the feeling that God is a Person.\n“Yours is the path of bhakti. That is very good; it is an easy path. Who can fully know the infinite God? and what need is there of knowing the infinite? Having attained this rare human birth, my supreme need is to develop love for the Lotus Feet of God.\n“If a jug of water is enough to remove my thirst, why should I measure the quantity of water in a lake? I become drunk on even half a bottle of wine — what is the use of my calculating the quantity of liquor in the tavern? What need is there of knowing the Infinite?

    "commentary": "It is clearly described how and by whom the Lord could be realised. Five essential qualities are mentioned here. Any being who could cultivate these qualities will attain the Lord without distinction of caste, creed, race or nationality. A potent medicine works on all who takes it. Anyone can light fire if oil, wick and match are secured. So is the Lord realisable by all who cultivate divine virtues.\n1)",
