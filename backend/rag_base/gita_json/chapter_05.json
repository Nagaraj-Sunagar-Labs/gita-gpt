But in the process of development, the Yoga of desireless action is superior to the renunciation of action.\nKarmayoga is better than Karmasannyasayoga. Arjuna has not yet attained the Self-state, devoid of the phenomenal universe. Millions of people live, move, and have their being in the objective world. It is not proper to teach them renunciation of action in the very beginning because they would not understand the true meaning of that doctrine. And, if a man without ripeness of Knowledge renounces action, he becomes a lost soul here and hereafter. The common man should act, work, carry out the injunctions of the Sastras, and do everything demanded of him as a duty in the course of his daily life. Such selfless devotion to duty will gradually purify the mind of all its\nlatent tendencies\n, and then man becomes fit to enter the Self-state, where there is no actor, no action and nothing to act.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda",

    "translation": "O Arjuna! He who neither hates nor desires should be known as of eternal renunciation; He who is not subject to the pairs of opposites is easily set free from bondage.",
    "commentary": "The meaning of Sannyasa is determined here. It signifies the abandoning of likes and dislikes and all the host of the pairs of opposites to which man is subjected every moment of his life. Sannyasa does not mean the abandoning of action.\nThus he who has freed himself from Raga and Dvesha is to be known as Nityasannyasi – the sage of eternal renunciation. The renunciation of others is only of a temporary accidental character. They may wear the ochre robes and appear outwardly to belong to the class of Sannyasins, but so long as their hearts are not tainted with desire and aversion, they are not the sannyasis in the real sense of the term. So, renunciation of the hindering influence of Raga and Dvesha is Sannyasa. Abandoning the pairs of opposites is Sannyasa. Elimination of the internal tendencies is Sannyasa. He who has not these qualities, though he adopts the external form is not really a Sannyasi. He who has these qualities, though he is a householder engaged in a hundred tasks is a real Sannyasi.\nEasily set free from bondage:\nMany people want to know if there is an easy path to salvation. Yes. There is. It is just giving up the selfishness which binds a man to the world by attachment and aversion. Such a man is\n‘nirdvandva’\n. He cuts the knots of Karma easily, though he may be a house-holder performing all the duties of his station in life.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda\nSwami Vivekananda Says —\nThe whole world is a mere child’s play — preaching, teaching, and all included. “Know him to be the sannyasin who neither hates not desires.” And what is there to be desired in this little mud-puddle of a world, with its ever-recurring misery, disease, and death? “He who has given up all desires, he alone is happy.”\n[Source]\nSri Ramakrishna Says —\nMASTER (\nto M\n.):\n“What need of the sandhya has a man who thinks of God day and night?\nWhat need of rituals has a man, what need of devotions any more,\nIf he repeats the Mother’s name at the three holy hours?\nRituals may pursue him close, but never can they overtake him.\nCharity, vows, and giving of gifts do not appeal to Madan’s mind;\nThe Blissful Mother’s Lotus Feet are his whole prayer and sacrifice.\n“The sandhya merges in the Gayatri, the Gayatri in Om. A man is firmly established in spiritual life when he goes into samadhi on uttering ‘Om’ only once.\n“There is a sadhu in Hrishikesh who gets up early in the morning and stands near a great waterfall. He looks at it the whole day and says to God: ‘Ah, You have done well! Well done! How amazing!’ He doesn’t practise any other form of japa or austerity. At night he returns to his hut.\n“What need is there even to bother one’s head about whether God is formless or has a form? It is enough for a man to pray to Him, alone in solitude, weeping, ‘O God, reveal Yourself to me as You are.’\n“God is both inside and outside. It is He who dwells inside us. Therefore the Vedas say, Tattvamasi — That thou art.’ God is also outside us. He appears manifold through maya; but in reality He alone exists. Therefore before describing the various names and forms of God, one should say, ‘Om Tat Sat.’ (“Om. That alone is Reality.”)\n“It is one thing to learn about God from the scriptures, and quite another to see Him. The scriptures only give hints. Therefore to read a great many scriptures is not necessary. It is much better to pray to God in solitude.\n“It isn’t necessary to read all of the\nGita\n. One can get the essence of the\nGita\nby repeating the word ten times. It becomes reversed and is then ‘tagi’. The essence of the book is: ‘O man, renounce everything and worship God.'” (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)",

    "translation": "Children, not the wise, say that Jnana yoga and karma yoga are distinct: He who is truly established in either of them obtains the fruit of both.",
    "commentary": "The Pandit mentioned here is the sage who knows the Truth and lives in it, and not a man of mere theoretical knowledge of the Sastras and the scriptures. Only the ignorant say that karma yoga and jnana yoga are distinct and separate.\nThe Lord makes the categorical declaration that the fruit of both the yogas is the same and that the Sadhaka who takes to one of them and is well established in it, will attain the highest fruit of both. Direct perception of Atma is the aim of all yogas.\nSome highly evolved men follow Jnana marga. They carry on the inquiry into the real nature of things and separate the Drik (the Seer) from the Drisya (the phenomenal world) as the mythical swan is able to separate milk and water. Thus they realise Atma through Jnana marga. Others, according to their natural tendencies, take to Karma marga, and through desireless action and surrender of the fruits to the Lord, reach the same goal of\nAtma-sakshatkara\nby their purified minds. The reward of freedom, liberation, is the same for both, only the paths differ. So, in both, the seeker aims at the absorption of the ego into the Self, and thereby transcends the feeling of personal doership. When the Jiva-idea is given up, what remains is only Sivatvam and nothing else. So the Lord exhorts the aspirant to take up either of the two yogas and practice it well.\nTruly established in:\nThe condition is that the practice of any yoga should be perfect and the\nsadhaka\nshould be firmly established in it. He should become an expert in the technique of the yoga which he follows. Then alone the desired result follows.\nThe history of the world provides many examples of great men who followed different paths and achieved the highest aim of life. The wisest of men in the Jnana marga have done the greatest service to humanity by their work. The greatest Karma yogis have always experienced\nAtma Jnana\nthrough a realisation of the universality of the Self in all their acts and achievements. Of course, it is quite clear that what man is aiming at is the destruction of his personal separateness from the universal, the merging of the Self in the universal Self and the realisation of the universe in his own self.\nNo wise man has ever disputed the truth of the different religions and creeds of the world. They practice not only tolerance but universal acceptance of all doctrines as paths to one goal. The radio of a circle reaches the centre from different positions and paths. The rivers reach the ocean through different ways. So one should give up narrowness and do not corp and cavil at those who do not follow the same path as his. Let there be a greater understanding and larger outlook in these matters which concern the people most. This is the message of the Lord.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda\nSwami Vivekananda Says —\nThe yogas of work, of wisdom, and of devotion are all capable of serving as direct and independent means for the attainment of moksha. “Fools alone say that work and philosophy are different, not the learned.” The learned know that, though apparently different from each other, they at last lead to the same goal of human perfection.\n[Source]\nSwami Turiyananda:\n“Some look upon these works as inferior to meditation. They do not know what they say. What is meditation? Why is it so highly looked upon? Because it is the way to the soul’s union with God. Now let us see what Swamiji who initiated the works meant. Did he ask you to merely attend on the patients or to worship Nârâyana in and through them? How then is this worship of Nârâyana different from meditation? It may be one cannot serve in this spirit, but one has no right therefore to call it inferior. Swamiji proclaimed this new path after realizing the Self as immanent in all things. But people do not understand it, and so want to move in the old grooves of spiritual practice. Three days of such service done in the right way will bring about spiritual realization. Such indeed has been the experience of everyone who has tried it. K-has told me that in those days when he was working in the hospital, he would always feel highly lifted up in spirit. Is not every man God Himself? ‘The Lord abides in every heart.’ If one fails to realize this, it is one’s own fault, none else’s.\n“Once when I made known to Shri Ramakrishna that my life’s ideal was to attain Nirvâna, he reproved me for entertaining such a low ideal. He said, ‘The ordinary man yearns for Nirvana. Have you not seen in a game of dice how cautiously the neophyte moves his pieces, keeping them in pairs to escape being checkmated, and how anxious is he to reach “home”! But the expert takes no caution. He deliberately turns down his pieces even when very near “home” so that the play might go on. And the dice become so attuned in his hands that he can cast any number he likes. Yes, the “expert” remains in the world and yet enjoys its fun. I was extremely astonished at the statement, and on my expressing a doubt, he reassured me that it was quite possible through the grace of the Mother. ‘She graciously makes the dice so attuned,’ he said metaphorically.” (Source: Spiritual Talks by the First Disciples of Sri Ramakrishna)\nRelated Articles:\nSome by meditation perceive the Self in themselves through the mind, some by devotion to knowledge, and some by devotion to work.

    "commentary": "The Lord reiterates the unity of Jnanayoga and Karmayoga in regard to the ultimate goal. The wise man sees the truth behind each sadhana and knows that though they are outwardly different, they are leading to the same consummation. It is only the ignorant who imagine that one path is superior to the other. These paths are intended to serve the needs of different aspirants born with different tendencies, and previous samskaras.\nOne can reach any part of the globe by going east or west. Similarly one can reach the spiritual goal by anyway. The harmonisation of different systems and creeds is the purpose of the Gita. At every step, the teacher of the Gita insists on the fact that the goal is the same, and explains the different paths from that standpoint. Hence the Gita is universal in its appeal to all mankind.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda\nSri Ramakrishna Says —\n“He who is called Brahman by the jnanis is known as Atman by the yogis and as Bhagavan by the bhaktas. The same brahmin is called priest, when worshipping in the temple, and cook, when preparing a meal in the kitchen. The jnani, sticking to the path of knowledge, always reasons about the Reality, saying, ‘Not this, not this’. Brahman is neither ‘this’ nor ‘that’; It is neither the universe nor its living beings. Reasoning in this way, the mind becomes steady. Then it disappears and the aspirant goes into samadhi. This is the Knowledge of Brahman. It is the unwavering conviction of the jnani that Brahman alone is real and the world illusory. All these names and forms are illusory, like a dream. What Brahman is cannot be described. One cannot even say that Brahman is a Person. This is the opinion of the jnanis, the followers of Vedanta philosophy.\n“But the bhaktas accept all the states of consciousness. They take the waking state to be real also. They don’t think the world to be illusory, like a dream. They say that the universe is a manifestation of God’s power and glory. God has created all these — sky, stars, moon, sun, mountains, ocean, men, animals. They constitute His glory.\nHe is within us, in our hearts. Again, He is outside. The most advanced devotees say that He Himself has become all this — the twenty-four cosmic principles, the universe, and all living beings. The devotee of God wants to eat sugar, not to become sugar.\n(\nAll laugh\n.)\n“Do you know how a lover of God feels? His attitude is: ‘O God, Thou art the Master, and I am Thy servant. Thou art the Mother, and I am Thy child.’ Or again: ‘Thou art my Father and Mother. Thou art the Whole, and I am a part.’ He doesn’t like to say, ‘I am Brahman.’\n“The yogi seeks to realise the Paramatman, the Supreme Soul. His ideal is the union of the embodied soul and the Supreme Soul. He withdraws his mind from sense-objects and tries to concentrate it on the Paramatman. Therefore, during the first stage of his spiritual discipline, he retires into solitude and with undivided attention practises meditation in a fixed posture.\n“But the Reality is one and the same. The difference is only in name. He who is Brahman is verily Atman, and again. He is the Bhagavan. He is Brahman to the followers of the path of knowledge, Paramatman to the yogis, and Bhagavan to the lovers of God.”\n(Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\nThe worshipful Lord said: I have proclaimed three types of communion for the spiritual enlightenment of man. These are the Yogas of Jnana, Karma and Bhakti. There is no other way besides these three. (Srimad Bhagavatam 11.20.6)",

That is, perfection in Karma Yoga – doing work without desire and attachment, surrendering the fruits to the Lord – is absolutely necessary to rise to the plane of pure Knowledge. Certainly, it is not an easy task to remain established in Brahman, without outward pulls and pressures of the objective world. All the bad samskaras have to be overcome, and they cannot be overcome except by righteous action and desireless performance of good work. Karma yoga is therefore the elementary course, and jnana yoga is the higher course. Unless the foundation of karma yoga is strongly laid, the superstructure of jnana cannot stand for a minute. How can anyone hope to remain fixed in the Atmic state when the mind is impure and drawn to the objective world in a hundred ways? Let the mind be purified first. Hence the Lord insists on Karmayoga for all seekers. Out of compassion, the Lord explains the natural sequence and graded progress of spiritual laws.",

Performance of Nishkama karma, purity of heart, conquest of mind, surrendering the senses, perception of the one Self in all beings – these are the characteristics of the man of perfect – wisdom.\nFrom this, we understand that the Karmayogi and Jnanayogi look-alike in the final stages of spiritual life.\nIf one possesses these five qualities, he is not tainted by his work in any way. If action is done for selfish purposes, with an impure mind and heart and slavery to the senses then such action binds man to the wheel of samsara.\nThe perception of the one Supreme Self in himself and in all beings leads the aspirant to the realisation of the unity of all things. For such a man there cannot be any hatred of others, no desire to injure others for his own profit, no envy and jealousy, no competitive spirit, no mental hurry to go ahead of every other man, as we find in the practical world.\nThe seeker should cultivate these qualities with all sincerity and devotion. Nothing can then bind him.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda\nSri Ramakrishna Says —\n“\nA man practises spiritual discipline, but his mind is on ‘woman and gold’ — it is turned toward enjoyment. Therefore, in his case, the spiritual discipline does not produce the right result.\n“Hazra used to practise much japa and austerity here. But in the country he has his wife, children, and land. Therefore along with his spiritual discipline he carried on the business of a broker. Such people cannot be true to their word. One moment they say they will give up fish, but the next moment they break their vow.\n“Is there anything that a man will not do for money? He will even compel a brahmin or a holy man to carry a load.\n“In my room sweets would turn bad; still I could not give them away to the worldly-minded. I could accept dirty water from others, but not even touch the jar of a worldly person.\n“At the sight of rich people Hazra would call them to him. He would give them long lectures. He would say to them: ‘You see Rakhal and the other youngsters. They do not practise any spiritual discipline. They simply wander about merrily.’\n“A man may live in a mountain cave, smear his body with ashes, observe fasts, and practise austere discipline; but if his mind dwells on worldly objects, on ‘woman and gold’, I say, ‘Shame on him!’ But I say that a man is blessed indeed who eats, drinks, and roams about, but who keeps his mind free from ‘woman and gold’.

He is convinced that the senses move among the objects of the senses.",
    "commentary": "The attitude of the man of perfect Knowledge is explained here. Atma is the witness of all phenomena. Just as the sun is only a witness to the various human actions that take place in the light that he sheds, just as the lamp is only a witness of the actions taking place in its light, Atma is just a witness of the activities of the body, the senses, and the mind, which take place by His all-pervading life-force. It remains untainted by them, ever pure and ever perfect.\nTo realise one’s own identity with Atma is the perfection of Knowledge.\nIn fact, there is only Atma, and the apparent existence of the individual-self is fiction. It is non-existent, and yet appears to exist. Ignorance (avidya) covers up the reality, and has imposed a fictitious sense of separateness on man, and so the thinks of himself as Jiva, separate from Paramatma. It is like the wave imagining itself to be separate from the ocean.\nThe Jiva, having imagined that he is a separate entity, identifies himself with the body, senses and mind. When the bodily organs are moving and acting, when the mind thinks and feels, he thinks that he is thinking and feeling. When the senses function in their own respective sense objects, he thinks that he is functioning. This body – identification is caused by ignorance. By spiritual sadhana and knowledge the wise man discovers the tremendous error of body-identification\n(dehatmabuddhi)\nand regains his original state of Atma. When\ndehatmabuddhi\nis removed, Atmabuddhi is achieved. In that state, the body, senses, and mind and all their functions and actions, are perceived as distinctly separate from the Self.\nPretensions to Jnana is a dangerous tendency. Since Atma is beyond all laws and since the Jiva is no other than Atma, it is quite possible for pretenders to be plunged in the mire of sense – pleasures, and claim immunity from and yet om them by simply repeating the slogan ‘I do not anything’. The Lord has declared the conditions of Jnana with perfect clarity. The Jnani who could say ‘I do not anything’ should be one whose heart is purified\n(visuddhatma)\nand whose senses are subdued (Jitendriyah). Of what avail is to say ‘I do not anything’, when at every step one is identifying himself with all the pleasures of the body and the senses? Let the seeker carry out a thorough search into a search into their own hearts and find out the taints and blemishes of lust, greed and hatred. Let these sins be purified first through Nishkamakarma, and then only the seekers would be fit to enter the plane of the pure Knowledge of the Self.\nFrom Tamas to Rajas, from Rajas to Sattva, and from Sattva to pure Sattva, from the lower to the higher the seeker has to rise gradually. One who has reached the state of pure Sattva cannot be drawn by the senses to indulge in the common pleasures of the body. His mind cannot dwell on worldly matters. His words do not smack of worldliness in any manner. In word, thought and deed, he is pure, nay purity is his He lives constantly in the light and bliss o of Brahman, he never more shall be diverted by the illusion of worldly enjoyment. Would a man who has awakened from his sleep think of and run after the pleasures of the dream? He knows that they are false and delusive.

    "translation": "The harmonised yogi who knows the essence of things, thinks “I do nothing”, seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, eating, moving, sleeping, breathing, speaking, giving, grasping, opening, and closing the eyelids even. He is convinced that the senses move among the objects of the senses.",
    "commentary": "The attitude of the man of perfect Knowledge is explained here. Atma is the witness of all phenomena. Just as the sun is only a witness to the various human actions that take place in the light that he sheds, just as the lamp is only a witness of the actions taking place in its light, Atma is just a witness of the activities of the body, the senses, and the mind, which take place by His all-pervading life-force. It remains untainted by them, ever pure and ever perfect.\nTo realise one’s own identity with Atma is the perfection of Knowledge.\nIn fact, there is only Atma, and the apparent existence of the individual-self is fiction. It is non-existent, and yet appears to exist. Ignorance (avidya) covers up the reality, and has imposed a fictitious sense of separateness on man, and so the thinks of himself as Jiva, separate from Paramatma. It is like the wave imagining itself to be separate from the ocean.\nThe Jiva, having imagined that he is a separate entity, identifies himself with the body, senses and mind. When the bodily organs are moving and acting, when the mind thinks and feels, he thinks that he is thinking and feeling. When the senses function in their own respective sense objects, he thinks that he is functioning. This body – identification is caused by ignorance. By spiritual sadhana and knowledge the wise man discovers the tremendous error of body-identification\n(dehatmabuddhi)\nand regains his original state of Atma. When\ndehatmabuddhi\nis removed, Atmabuddhi is achieved. In that state, the body, senses, and mind and all their functions and actions, are perceived as distinctly separate from the Self.\nPretensions to Jnana is a dangerous tendency. Since Atma is beyond all laws and since the Jiva is no other than Atma, it is quite possible for pretenders to be plunged in the mire of sense – pleasures, and claim immunity from and yet om them by simply repeating the slogan ‘I do not anything’. The Lord has declared the conditions of Jnana with perfect clarity. The Jnani who could say ‘I do not anything’ should be one whose heart is purified\n(visuddhatma)\nand whose senses are subdued (Jitendriyah). Of what avail is to say ‘I do not anything’, when at every step one is identifying himself with all the pleasures of the body and the senses? Let the seeker carry out a thorough search into a search into their own hearts and find out the taints and blemishes of lust, greed and hatred. Let these sins be purified first through Nishkamakarma, and then only the seekers would be fit to enter the plane of the pure Knowledge of the Self.\nFrom Tamas to Rajas, from Rajas to Sattva, and from Sattva to pure Sattva, from the lower to the higher the seeker has to rise gradually. One who has reached the state of pure Sattva cannot be drawn by the senses to indulge in the common pleasures of the body. His mind cannot dwell on worldly matters. His words do not smack of worldliness in any manner. In word, thought and deed, he is pure, nay purity is his He lives constantly in the light and bliss o of Brahman, he never more shall be diverted by the illusion of worldly enjoyment. Would a man who has awakened from his sleep think of and run after the pleasures of the dream? He knows that they are false and delusive. So would the Jnani understand that all the pleasures which he had in the past were only the reflections of a mirage, and he has been fooled too frequently by mistaking the apparent to be the Real. So he is careful to remain steadfast in the Self. It is only such a man of Self-knowledge who can say – ‘I do not anything.’ Such men have done great work for the good of humanity, without the least trace of personal doership.\nSo, first of all, by the practice of Nishkama Karma, devotion to God, Dhyana, the heart should be purified and the Self should be realised through direct experience.

    "commentary": "The doctrine of Karmayoga is restated here. All actions should be surrendered in the Eternal, and all personal attachments to the fruits thereof should be given up. There should be no feeling of personal doership. Such a worker is not affected by sin. The idea is illustrated by means of a simile. The lotus leaf is in water, and yet it is not tainted by the water rolling over and around it. Similarly, the expert in Karmayoga is engaged in a thousand activities, but he is not touched or tainted by sin in any way.\nBy the Knowledge he has acquired, he knows that all objects and actions are only reflected images in the Supreme Brahman. He is himself That. So there are no desires or attachments for him. Having themselves escaped from the torments of karma, they work for the spiritual uplift of humanity. They are free because they know the Truth, and they have surrendered everything to the Lord or the eternal Brahman.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda\nSwami Vivekananda Says —\n“Whosoever lives in the midst of the world, and works, and gives up all the fruit of his action unto the Lord, he is never touched with the evils of the world. Just as the lotus, born under the water, rises up and blossoms above the water, even so is the man who is engaged in the activities of the world, giving up all the fruit of his activities unto the Lord.”\n[Source]\nHe [Krishna] taught that a man ought to live in this world like a lotus leaf, which grows in water but is never moistened by water; so a man ought to live in the world — his heart to God and his hands to work.\n[Source]\nThe aim and end in this life for the jnana-yogi is to become this jivanmukta, “living-free”. He is jivanmukta who can live in this world without being attached. He is like the lotus leaves in water, which are never wetted by the water.\n[Source]\nThe Lord Himself works incessantly and is ever without attachment. Just as water cannot wet the lotus leaf, so work cannot bind the unselfish man by giving rise to attachment to results. The selfless and unattached man may live in the very heart of a crowded and sinful city; he will not be touched by sin.\n[Source]\nSo karma-yoga says, first destroy the tendency to project this tentacle of selfishness, and when you have the power of checking it, hold it in and do not allow the mind to get into the ways of selfishness. Then you may go out into the world and work as much as you can. Mix everywhere, go where you please; you will never be contaminated with evil. There is the lotus leaf in the water; the water cannot touch and adhere to it; so will you be in the world. This is called vairagya, dispassion or non-attachment. I believe I have told you that without non-attachment there cannot be any kind of yoga. Non-attachment is the basis of all the yogas.\n[Source]\nIf a man plunges headlong into foolish luxuries of the world without knowing the truth, he has missed his footing, he cannot reach the goal. And if a man curses the world, goes into a forest, mortifies his flesh, and kills himself little by little by starvation, makes his heart a barren waste, kills out all feelings, and becomes harsh, stern, and dried-up, that man also has missed the way. These are the two extremes, the two mistakes at either end. Both have lost the way, both have missed the goal.\nSo work, says the Vedanta, putting God in everything, and knowing Him to be in everything. Work incessantly, holding life as something deified, as God Himself, and knowing that this is all we have to do, this is all we should ask for. God is in everything, where else shall we go to find Him? He is already in every work, in every thought, in every feeling. Thus knowing, we must work — this is the only way, there is no other. Thus the effects of work will not bind us. We have seen how false desires are the cause of all the misery and evil we suffer, but when they are thus deified, purified, through God, they bring no evil, they bring no misery. Those who have not learnt this secret will have to live in a demoniacal world until they discover it. Many do not know what an infinite mine of bliss is in them, around them, everywhere; they have not yet discovered it. What is a demoniacal world? The Vedanta says, ignorance.\n[Source]\nSri Ramakrishna Says —\nMASTER:\n“A devotee who can call on God while living a householder’s life is a hero indeed. God thinks: ‘He who has renounced the world for My sake will surely pray to Me. He must serve Me. Is there anything very remarkable about it? People will cry shame on him if he fails to do so. But he is blessed indeed who prays to Me in the midst of his worldly duties. He is trying to find Me, overcoming a great obstacle — pushing away, as it were, a huge block of stone weighing a ton. Such a man is a real hero.'”\nPUNDIT:\n“You are right, sir. The scripture says the same thing. There is in the\nMahabharata\nthe story of the ‘pious hunter’ and the ‘chaste woman’. Once a hermit was disturbed in his meditation by a crow. When he cast an angry glance at the bird, it was reduced to ashes. The hermit said to himself: ‘I have destroyed the crow by a mere glance. I must have made great progress in spiritual life.’ One day he went to a woman’s house to beg his food. She was devoted to her husband and served him day and night; she provided him with water to wash his feet and even dried them with her hair. When the hermit knocked at her door for alms, she was serving her husband and could not open the door at once. The hermit, in a fit of anger, began to curse her. The chaste woman answered from the inner apartments: ‘I am not your crow. Wait a few minutes, sir. After finishing my service to my husband I shall give you my attention.’ The hermit was very much surprised to find that this simple woman was aware of his having burnt the crow to ashes. He wanted her to give him spiritual instruction. At her bidding he went to the ‘pious hunter’ at Benares. This hunter sold meat, but he also served his parents day and night as embodiments of God. The hermit said to himself in utter amazement: ‘Why, he is a butcher and a worldly man! How can he give me the Knowledge of Brahman?’ But the hunter was a knower of Brahman and had acquired divine knowledge through the performance of his worldly duties. The hermit was illumined by the instruction of the pious hunter’.”\nThe Master was about to take his leave. He was standing at the door of the next house, where Ishan’s father-in-law lived. Ishan and the other devotees stood by the Master. They were waiting to bid him good-bye. Sri Ramakrishna said to Ishan:\n“Live in the world like an ant. The world contains a mixture of truth and untruth, sugar and sand. Be an ant and take the sugar.\n“Again, the world is a mixture of milk and water, the bliss of God-Consciousness and the pleasure of sense-enjoyment. Be a swan and drink the milk, leaving the water aside.\n“Live in the world like a waterfowl. The water clings to the bird, but the bird shakes it off. Live in the world like a mudfish. The fish lives in the mud, but its skin is always bright and shiny.\n“The world is indeed a mixture of truth and make-believe. Discard the make-believe and take the truth.” (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\nSubhadra Mataji lived in a small ashram in Dharali, located about 9,000 feet up in the Himalayas near Gangotri. She was a worshipper of the baby Krishna (Gopala) and maintained the spiritual attitude that every person who visited her was actually Gopala.  Her primary practice was cooking for and feeding the pilgrims and visitors who passed through, often responding to their demands to be fed.\nThe Story of the Arati and the Chapati\nOne evening, while Mataji was performing the evening arati (ritual worship) before the picture of Gopala, a person outside shouted for food. She immediately put down the ritual lamp and went into the kitchen to make chapatis (bread) for the visitor.  The devotees present were annoyed and asked her to at least finish the ritual worship of Gopala before going to cook. She called out from the kitchen, explaining that cooking for the hungry visitor was the arati of Gopala. For her, there was no difference between the ritual in the shrine and the act of feeding the hungry; both were worship.\nThe Story of Serving with High Fever\nOn another occasion, Mataji was suffering from a high fever when someone outside shouted, demanding to be fed. Despite her illness, she struggled up, cooked, and fed the person. Observers commented on how insensitive people were for not caring about her suffering. She acknowledged that while people are of various kinds (some respectful, some insensitive), ultimately, “all of them are Gopala”.  This demonstrated her ability to harmonize her life by seeing the divine (“the one”) in everyone and every activity, effectively spiritualizing her entire life.(Source:\nImitation of Christ | Swami Sarvapriyananda\n)\n—–\nZeros and Ones\nSri Ramakrishna compared life to a string of zeros. He said that no matter how many zeros you place one after another, their value remains zero. However, if you place the number “one” before them, they immediately gain value—one zero becomes ten, two become a hundred, and three become a thousand. The “One” represents God or spirituality. The “zeros” represent all other aspects of life, such as education, jobs, family, career, money, and fame. On their own, worldly pursuits (the zeros) may not count for much or bring lasting fulfillment. But if you place God (the One) first and center your life around spirituality, everything else gains deep purpose and value.\nThe Pillar\nChildren spin round and round while holding onto a pillar. They enjoy the high of spinning, but they are very careful to hold tight to the pillar because they know that letting go would cause them to fall and get hurt. Holding onto the pillar represents holding onto God. The act of spinning round and round represents the activities of samsara (worldly life) and whatever duties we perform. One can engage in the “spinning” of worldly life—jobs, family, and duties—as long as one maintains a firm hold on God (the pillar) through their spiritual practice or tradition. life. (Source:\nImitation of Christ | Swami Sarvapriyananda\n)\nIsa Upanishad Verse 1 & 2 :\nVerse 1\n:  All this-whatever exists in this changing universe-should be covered by the Lord. Protect the Self by renunciation. Lust not after any man’s wealth.\nVerse 2\n: If a man wishes to live a hundred years on this earth, he should live performing action. For you, who cherish such a desire and regard yourself as a man, there is no other way by which you can keep work from clinging to you.\nHe who has realized the Self, which is innate, unborn, and inconceivable, is\nnot contaminated by any evil\n, even if he acts in whatever way he likes. And once he is free from ignorance,\nhe cannot perform any action.\nFor that reason the self-controlled mendicant is never bound.\n– Avadhuta Gita 2.30\nNot contaminated by any evil\n—The Brahma Sutras (an authoritative text of Vedanta) says: “On the realization of that Brahman, there occur the non-attachment and destruction of the subsequent and previous sins respectively, because it is declared by the scriptures.” (\n4.1.13\n)\nHe cannot perform any action\n—Because action originates from desire, and desire originates from ignorance.\nThe Chhandogya Upanishad says: “As water does not cling to the lotus leaf, so no evil clings to one who knows Brahman.” (\n4.14.3\n)\nRelated Articles:\nWhatever you do, whatever you eat, whatever you offer in sacrifice, whatever you give away, and whatever you practise in the form of austerities, Ο son of Kunti— do it as an offering to Me.

The non-integrated man suffers bondage because his actions are impelled by a desire for enjoyment. Freedom is attained by desirelessness, bondage is caused by desire. The perfected karma yogi enjoys the eternal peace of Brahman and the Jnana yogi also enjoys the peace of the Eternal. Peace, supreme peace, is the goal of the two types of yoga. Both lead to Self-realisation.\nPeace is the direct result of non-attachment. All the restlessness, frustration, ill-will, hatred, and struggle are caused by attachment to worldly objects and thirst for pleasures. When the yogi discovers higher joy in Atma untainted by any disturbing factors, he finds no relish for the lower pleasures of the material world. And this non-attachment leads to supreme peace. So the aspirants should analyse the cause of suffering in the world, and when he analyses the problem, he would naturally find out that the attachments are the root cause for all the storms and tempests in their minds. Give up desire and attachment, peace is yours – This is the Lord’s message.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda\nSwami Vivekananda Says —\nWe read in the Bhagavad Gita again and again that we must all work incessantly. All work is by nature composed of good and evil. We cannot do any work which will not do some good somewhere; there cannot be any work which will not cause some harm somewhere. Every work must necessarily be a mixture of good and evil; yet we are commanded to work incessantly. Good and evil will both have their results, will produce their karma. Good action will entail upon us good effect; bad action, bad. But good and bad are both bondages of the soul. The solution reached in the Gita in regard to this bondage-producing nature of work is that, if we do not attach ourselves to the work we do, it will not have any binding effect on our soul.\n[Source]\nSri Ramakrishna Says —\nMASTER:\n“Shall I tell you the truth? What will you gain by mere scholarship? The pundits hear many things and know many things — the Vedas, the Puranas, the Tantras. But of what avail is mere scholarship? Discrimination and renunciation are necessary. If a man has discrimination and renunciation, then one can listen to him. But of what use are the words of a man who looks on the world as the essential thing?\n“What is the lesson of the\nGita\n? It is what you get by repeating the word ten times. As you repeat ‘Gita’, ‘Gita’, the word becomes reversed into ‘tagi’, ‘tagi’ — which implies renunciation. He alone has understood the secret of the Gita who has renounced his attachment to ‘woman and gold’ and has directed his entire love to God. It isn’t necessary to read the whole of the\nGita\n. The purpose of reading the book is served if one practises renunciation.”\nDR. SARKAR:\n“A man once explained the meaning of Radha to me. He said to me: ‘Do you know the meaning of Radha? Reverse the word and it becomes “dhara.” That’s the meaning.’ (\nAll laugh\n.) Well, let us stop here for today.” (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)",

If the senses and a mind are not under control, even the conquest of the whole world is of no avail. Man cannot be happy. Therefore having controlled the mind and the senses the yogi rests happily in the body –\n(Vasi sukham aste)\n.\nThe yogi should renounce all actions mentally. That is, he should give up the sense of doership and the attachment for the fruits of work.\nThe body may work but the dweller in the body is completely at rest because he knows that the mind and the senses are functioning according to their own nature, and he the Drik (seer) is just a witness.\nThere is no identification of the Self with the functions of nature. So the principle is to abandon all actions in the mind. The body, according to its own nature goes on acting according to its own laws. This mental renunciation is karma-Sannyasa, and not abstaining from work as idlers and incapacitated persons do. When one attains this karma-Sannyasa, he rests peacefully in his own state. He neither acts nor causes anything else to act.\nThe individual self rests in Atma unattached to and unaffected by anything taking place in and through the nine-gated city of the body.\nIn the nine-gated city:\nThe body is described metaphysically as a city of nine gates – two eyes, two ears, two nasal passages, mouth, urethra and anus. The Self is the ruling monarch of this nine-gated city. In ancient times every great city had high gateways in different directions. When these gateways are fortified and strongly guarded, the King remains safe and secure. But if they are undefended, enemies can easily enter and disturb the city.\nMaterial enjoyments and pleasures are the enemies who come in through the gateways of the senses, enter the mind, and shake the throne of the monarch, harassing him in different ways. But the man of Self-control (Vasi) keeps those gate-ways closely guarded, and so he rests happily in his own state.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda",

Nature carries on the whole of this universal drama according to its own laws. By the power of Prakriti man has attached himself to actions, and thinks that he is acting, enjoying suffering, and that he is the doer. In fact, it is not the real man that is the doer. The personal agent is a spurious idea created by the power of Maya. Having thus forgotten his real nature, man has created for himself a wilderness of likes and dislikes, good and bad-evil desires, and those samskaras go on functioning in their own way through the variegated phenomena of life. To know this secret is Knowledge.\nWhen a man does evil, it is not the real Self that does evil, but man’s nature. When a man does good, it is not the real Self that does good, but man’s nature. So, the evil accumulated in one’s nature should be counteracted by the good, and then one should rise above both good and evil in the realisation of Atma. The seeker need not be disheartened by the evil in him. It is his own making, and what he has done, he can undo also. Effort is needed in that direction for self-purification. This struggle is the natural order of life. The Lord has nothing to do with it. Man has to attain purification by his own effort. The Lord here states that personal agency, actions and their results are all conducted by the power of Prakriti.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda",

    "translation": "The Lord does not receive either the evil or good of anyone. Knowledge is enveloped by ignorance, and by it, beings are deluded.",
    "commentary": "The good and the bad done by man affect him only, God does not touch either. If a man does good, he enjoys the fruits of his good work. If he does evil, he suffers the result of his bad actions. God has nothing to do with them. Thus the whole responsibility is placed on man himself, as the maker of his own destiny. It is utter foolishness to imagine that God is conferring happiness on some people and suffering on others. No. He does neither. Man suffers from his own evil deeds. God is the eternal witness of this wonderful human life, with all its passions, victories and defeats, pleasures and pains, loves and hatreds and so on. He is Sakshi (witness).\nIn the second line, the Lord explains how this so-called earthly life is carried on by all beings. Knowledge is covered up by ignorance and by this, all beings are deluded. Every man in his real nature is the immortal Self and not the perishable body. But by ignorance, man has come to think that he is the body. By this delusion, man is subjecting himself to all the shocks and ills of earthly life and is bound to the wheel of birth and death. But this ignorance (avidya) though is without a beginning has an end. A remote mountain cave is filled with darkness from time immemorial, and yet it is shattered the moment a light is brought into it. Thus Knowledge when it flashes on the heart ends all ignorance in a fraction of a second. When man realises his real nature, ignorance is destroyed. Therefore it is the duty of every man to remove the evil of ignorance and know himself as the immortal Self. There is nothing new to be acquired. Man has only to take off the blinding mask and understand his own true nature.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda",

    "translation": "But for those whose ignorance is destroyed by the knowledge of Atma that Knowledge, like the sun, reveals the Supreme Brahman.",
    "commentary": "In the previous\nverse\n, it is stated that knowledge is covered by ignorance, and so man suffers misery. Here the way to remove sorrow is shown. Ignorance is the cause of sorrow, and Knowledge alone could remove ignorance. Knowledge of Atma is to be acquired by spiritual practices like hearing, contemplation, meditation etc. And such Knowledge reveals the Supreme Being, Brahman, just as the Sun reveals the sense-world. just as the Sun reveals the objects in the sense-worl\nLike the sun:\nWhen thick clouds spread over the sky, the Sun is hidden and the world is plunged into darkness. Powerful winds drive away the clouds, and immediately the glorious light of the Sun is revealed. Thereby all the objects of the sense-world become visible to us. Even so, the light of Atma is covered up by ignorance. When this ignorance is removed by knowledge, Atma shines forth with all its glory.\nIt should be clearly understood that Atma is not something to be created by anybody by some kind of spiritual discipline. Atma is already there, unaffected by anything, just as the Sun is there even when the clouds cover him up. Only the covering is to be taken away. Atma is unveiled.\nWhen it is said that Knowledge causes Atma to shine forth, it does not mean that Atma is illumined by knowledge. Atma is Self-luminous. It is unlike material objects which are not self-luminous but which shine by the light of the Sun. Atma does not require anything else to illumine itself. It illumines all.\nWhen ignorance (Jivabuddhi) is destroyed, Atma is experienced, and that is Knowledge.\nLet us take the illustration of a lamp kept under a pot. When the pot covers it, the lamp is hidden, and light is not seen. When the pot is broken, the light of the lamp shines forth. The covering of ignorance is shattered by Knowledge and then the light of Atma is unveiled by His own original power.\nEither by Nishkama karma or by devotion or by Dhyana or by all these methods put together, man has to obtain knowledge of the real Self to overcome the sorrows of his earthly existence.\nIt is to be noted that this Knowledge is free for all humanity to secure without distinction of caste, creed, race colour or sex. Each soul is potentially divine. Whoever breaks through the clouds of ignorance will come face to face with the glorious Sun of Atma.\nEach individual has the light of Atma in himself shining like the Sun. Even the light of the Sun is only a reflection of the light of Atma.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda",

    "translation": "With their intellect absorbed in That, their Self being That, established in that, they go from whence there is no return and their sins are dispelled by knowledge.",
    "commentary": "The realisation of Brahman being the final goal of all spiritual practices, what is the duty of the aspirant? He should think of that at all times, he should merge himself in That, he should be firmly rooted in That, and he should have no other thing except That as the sole refuge and aim. Such a man alone can realise Brahman.\nIt is a psychological truth that man becomes That which he contemplates. By ignorance, man is contemplating samsara, and so he is bound by it by the effect of his own absorption in it. Now the sadhana should be made in the opposite direction. Mind should contemplate the Supreme Reality, the freedom of the self, and if this is done constantly till the whole personality is filled with that, then the Atma becomes manifest as the Reality in man.\nIt is true that the mind cannot all of a sudden become absorbed in That. The mind oscillates between the objective world on the one side, and Atma on the other. But constant, unremitting and intense practice will fix the direction of the mind towards Atma. All great men have gone through this practice. They have concentrated all their energies in Atma, and dedicated their whole being to That. And thus they have realised the Supreme.\nTo the birthless and deathless state:\n‘\nPunaravritti\n‘ means taking birth again and becoming bound by samsara. Birthlessness\n(apunaravrtitti)\nis the state of final emancipation.\nSins dispelled by Knowledge:\nWho shall attain that state? Those who are free from sin and evil, free from ignorance and delusion, attain that state. How can sin be destroyed? By the Knowledge of Atma. So long as there is the least trace of evil, the light is not revealed. So the enveloping darkness of evil should be shattered by Knowledge. Constant thought and meditation on Atma bring spiritual knowledge to man.\nIs it not true that the man engaged in worldly pursuits, attains success by the concentration of all his energies on that object which he desires to acquire? Day and night, the wealthy are adding to their possessions. Most people spend their whole life and energy acquiring lands, houses, positions, name and fame. They come to possess these things by the very force of their efforts. And yet they still live in a state of fear, and suffer terrible torture of the mind. If they can turn their interest and energy towards the spiritual quest, they can easily acquire that Knowledge by which they can ever afterwards live a life of fearlessness, joy, and perfect freedom. Atma-Jnana is the greatest acquisition for a human being, because by it he transcends all the fears and sorrows of life, and lives in restful peace, bliss and blessedness.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda\n—–\nRelated audio by Swami Sarvapriyananda\nSri Ramakrishna Says —\nMASTER (\nto the devotees\n):\n“I have heard a great deal about Buddha. He is one of the ten Incarnations of God. (Hindu mythology speaks of ten Incarnations of God.) Brahman is immovable, immutable, inactive, and of the nature of Consciousness.\nWhen a man merges his\nbuddhi\n, his intelligence, in\nBodha\n, Consciousness, then he attains the Knowledge of Brahman; he becomes\nbuddha\n, enlightened.\n“Nangta used to say that the mind merges in the buddhi, and the buddhi in Bodha, Consciousness.\n“The aspirant does not attain the Knowledge of Brahman as long as he is conscious of his ego. The ego comes under one’s control after one has obtained the Knowledge of Brahman and seen God. Otherwise the ego cannot be controlled. It is difficult to catch one’s own shadow. But when the sun is overhead, the shadow is within a few inches of the body.”\n…..\nMASTER:\n“One should keep pictures of holy men in one’s room. That constantly quickens divine ideas.”\nBANNERJI:\n“I have your picture in my room; also the picture of a sadhu living in the mountains, blowing on a piece of lighted charcoal in a bowl of hemp.” (Many wandering monks smoke Indian hemp.)\nMASTER:\n“It is true that one’s spiritual feelings are awakened by looking at the picture of a sadhu. It is like being reminded of the custard-apple by looking at an imitation one, or like stimulating the desire for enjoyment by looking at a young woman. Therefore I tell you that you should constantly live in the company of holy men.\n(\nTo Bannerji\n) “You know very well the suffering of the world. You suffer whenever you accept enjoyment. As long as the kite kept the fish in its beak, it was tormented by the flock of crows.\n“One finds peace of mind in the company of holy men. The alligator remains under water a long time. But every now and then it rises to the surface and breathes with a deep wheezing noise. Then it gives a sigh of relief.”\nACTOR:\n“Revered sir, what you have just said about enjoyment is very true. One ultimately courts disaster if one prays to God for enjoyment. Various desires come to the mind and by no means all of them are good. God is the Kalpataru, the Wish-fulfilling Tree. A man gets whatever he asks of God. Suppose it comes to his mind: ‘God is the Kalpataru. Well, let me see if a tiger will appear before me.’ Because he thinks of the tiger, it really appears and devours him.”\nMASTER:\n“Yes, you must remember that the tiger comes. What more shall I tell you? Keep your mind on God. Don’t forget Him. God will certainly reveal Himself to you if you pray to Him with sincerity. Another thing, Sing the name of God at the end of each performance. Then the actors, the singers, and the audience will go home with the thought of God in their minds.”\nThe actors saluted the Master and took their leave.\nTwo ladies, devotees of Sri Ramakrishna, entered the room and saluted the Master. They had been fasting in preparation for this visit. They were sisters-in-law, the wives of two brothers, and were twenty-two or twenty- three years old. They were mothers of children. Both of them had their faces covered with veils.\nMASTER (\nto the ladies\n):\n“Worship Siva. This worship is described in a book called the\nNityakarma\n. Learn the rituals from it.\nIn order to perform the worship of God you will be preoccupied for a long time with such religious duties as plucking flowers, making sandal-paste, polishing the utensils of worship, and arranging offerings. As you perform these duties your mind will naturally be directed to God. You will get rid of meanness, anger, jealousy, and so forth.\nWhen you two sisters talk to each other, always talk about spiritual matters.\n“The thing is somehow to unite the mind with God. You must not forget Him, not even once. Your thought of Him should be like the flow of oil, without any interruption (\nBG 6.19\n). It you worship with love even a brick or stone as God, then through His grace you can see Him.\n“Remember what I have just said to you. One should perform such worship as the Siva Puja. Once the mind has become mature, one doesn’t have to continue formal worship for long. The mind then always remains united with God; meditation and contemplation become a constant habit of mind.” (\nBG 3.17\n,\nBG 3.18\n) (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\nRelated Articles:\nHaving obtained this Brahmi state man is not deluded. Being established in this even at the end of life man attains oneness with Brahman (Moksha). (\nBG 2.72\n)\nThe Lord said: Hear, Ο Pārtha, how, with your mind attached to Me, and taking refuge in Me, and practising yoga, you will without any doubt know Me in full. (\nBG 7.1\n)",

    "translation": "Even here (while living in this body) birth and death (samsara) are overcome by those whose mind is established in equality; Brahman is untainted and is the same in all; therefore in brahman, they rest.",
    "commentary": "Mind is the cause of bondage or freedom. If the mind is corrupt and unbalanced, it is bondage. If the mind is pure and equal, it is freedom. Therefore the Lord declares that the man who keeps his mind pure and balanced conquers the bondage of samsara. While living in this body, the man becomes free – a Jivanmukta the living free.\nThe reason for it is that Atma, the Self, is free from evil and is always balanced. Who-so-ever acquires these attributes of Atma has their life and being in Atma. Like things mix together and not unlike things. Water mixes with water and not with oil. Oil mixes with oil and not with milk. So to become Atma, one should cultivate Atma dharma. Two attributes are mentioned here as Atma dharma are purity and balance. When these qualities are acquired, man realises Brahman. –\nWhen the mind acquires purity, objectlessness, balance equal to that of Atma, man attains emancipation.\nMoksha\nis purity of mind illumined by Knowledge. If one keeps the mind pure and balanced, he is free, now and here, and not elsewhere and at a distant time. There are no conditions of time and place. Wherever he is and whatever he is, if one acquires purity and balance of mind he attains freedom.\nMind established in equality:\nIt means that the mind is balanced, free from the unsettling waves of attraction and repulsion while moving through the objective world. This balance is achieved by the Jnani as he is able to perceive the one Self in all beings. So much so there is no mental disturbance at all for him.\nThe highest state of freedom could be achieved while living in this body. This gives the greatest hope for suffering humanity. It is not after death that their freedom is attained. It is attained here and now by the aspirant whose mind is free and balanced.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda\nSwami Vivekananda Says —\nBreaking the bondages of all, the chains of all, declaring liberty to all to reach the highest goal, come the words of the Gita, rolls like thunder the mighty voice of Krishna: “Even in this life they have conquered relativity, whose minds are firmly fixed upon the sameness, for God is pure and the same to all, therefore such are said to be living in God.”\n[Source]\n“Even in this life he has conquered relative existence whose mind is firmly fixed on this sameness, for the Lord is one and the same to all, and the Lord is pure; therefore those who have this sameness for all, and are pure, are said to be living in God.” This is the gist of Vedantic morality — this sameness for all.\n[Source]\nTherefore the absolute sameness of conditions, if that be the aim of ethics, appears to be impossible. That all men should be the same, could never be, however we might try. Men will be born differentiated; some will have more power than others; some will have natural capacities, others not; some will have perfect bodies, others not. We can never stop that. At the same time ring in our ears the wonderful words of morality proclaimed by various teachers: “Thus, seeing the same God equally present in all, the sage does not injure Self by the Self, and thus reaches the highest goal. Even in this life they have conquered relative existence whose minds are firmly fixed on this sameness; for God is pure, and God is the same to all. Therefore such are said to be living in God.” We cannot deny that this is the real idea; yet at the same time comes the difficulty that the sameness as regards external forms and position can never be attained.\n[Source]\nDualism is the natural idea of the senses; as long as we are bound by the senses we are bound to see a God who is only Personal, and nothing but Personal, we are bound to see the world as it is. Says Ramanuja, “So long as you think you are a body, and you think you are a mind, and you think you are a jiva, every act of perception will give you the three — Soul, and nature, and something as causing both.” But yet, at the same time, even the idea of the body disappears where the mind itself becomes finer and finer, till it has almost disappeared, when all the different things that make us fear, make us weak, and bind us down to this body-life have disappeared. Then and then alone one finds out the truth of that grand old teaching. What is the teaching? “Even in this life they have conquered the round of birth and death whose minds are firm-fixed on the sameness of everything, for God is pure and the same to all, and therefore such are said to be living in God.”\n[Source]\nBut above all, let me once more remind you that here is need of practical work, and the first part of that is that you should go to the sinking millions of India, and take them by the hand, remembering the words of the Lord Krishna: “Even in this life they have conquered relative existence whose minds are firm-fixed on the sameness of everything, for God is pure and the same to all; therefore, such are said to be living in God.”\n[Source]\nThis is what one of your ancestors said: “Even in this life, they have conquered relativity whose mind is fixed in sameness” — one who is believed to be God incarnate. We all believe it. Are his words then vain and without meaning? If not, and we know they are not, any attempt against this perfect equality of all creation, irrespective of birth, sex, or even qualification, is a terrible mistake, and no one can be saved until he has attained to this idea of sameness. Follow, therefore, noble Prince, (The Raja of Khetri) the teachings of the Vedanta, not as explained by this or that commentator, but as the Lord within you understands them. Above all, follow this great doctrine of sameness in all things, through all beings, seeing the same God in all. This is the way to freedom; inequality, the way to bondage. No man and no nation can attempt to gain physical freedom without physical equality, nor mental freedom without mental equality. Ignorance, inequality, and desire are the three causes of human misery, and each follows the other in inevitable union. Why should a man think himself above any other man, or even an animal? It is the same throughout: “त्वं स्त्री त्वं पुमानसि त्वं कुमार उत वा कुमारि — Thou art the man, Thou the woman, Thou art the young man, Thou the young woman.” Many will say, “That is all right for the sannyasins, but we are householders.” No doubt, a householder having many other duties to perform, cannot as fully attain to this sameness; yet this should be also their ideal, for it is the ideal of all societies, of all mankind, all animals, and all nature, to attain to this sameness.\n[Source]\nThe yogi says, every man is a slave except the yogi. He is a slave of food, to air, to his wife, to his children, to a dollar, slave to a nation, slave to name and fame, and to a thousand things in this world. The man who is not controlled by any one of these bondages is alone a real man, a real yogi. “They have conquered relative existence in this life who are firm-fixed in sameness. God is pure and the same to all. Therefore such are said to be living in God.”\n[Source]\n“They indeed have conquered Heaven even in this life whose mind has become fixed in sameness. God is pure and same to all, therefore they are said to be in God.” Desire, ignorance, and inequality — this is the trinity of bondage. Denial of the will to live, knowledge, and same-sightedness is the trinity of liberation.\n[Source]",

The wise and the ignorant could easily be distinguished by their conduct, in the same way as we could distinguish a blind man by his gait. The knower of Brahman is untroubled by the occurrence of unpleasant things, nor is he elated when good things come to him. His intellect does not waver in wear and woe.\nHe knows by direct vision that worldly life as we see and live it with a deluded mind and confused intellect, is a dream that has no reality about it. He knows that it is a mirage, appearing to be full of water and beautiful, but only a sandy desert. Those who know the mirage are no longer deluded by its apparent attraction. In the same way, to the knower of Brahman the world is unreal\n(Midhya)\nfrom the spiritual point of view. So he is not moved by joy or sorrow by the diverse pattern of human existence.\nOf steady intellect, not deluded (sthirabudhih – asammudhar):\nThe purified intellect of the knower of Brahman is firm and immovable, because it has transcended all fictitious notions of the world, pleasures and pains, etc. The intellect of the ignorant man is shrouded in delusion, and so, like a weather-cock it is unsteady and turns round and round by every gust of wind. The light of Atma illumines the whole universe and the wise man knows what is real and what is unreal with absolute clearness.\nFrom this, we understand that the aspirant who practises steadiness of mind, who keeps his intellect equal and balanced, unites himself with Brahman.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda",

    "translation": "With mind unattached to external contacts he finds happiness in Atma and with mind united with Brahman (Atma) in meditation, he enjoys imperishable happiness.",
    "commentary": "Eternal happiness is only in the Self and nowhere else. All other kinds of happiness arising from the contact of the senses with the external world are only short-lived and mixed with pain. They come and go. They are only the reflected joys of the Self. Real joy is only in Atma. The source of all happiness is inside and not outside. Not believing this truth, much less knowing it, the ignorant are deluded by thinking that happiness is coming to them through external objects. The dog biting the bone bruises its own mouth and licks its own blood thinking that it is coming from the bone. So is the ignorant man who runs after the elusive pleasures of life and is constantly cheated by them. Even after the repeated experience, he does not change his attitude. It has become a habitual way of thinking for the common man.\nThe wise man who has enquired into the nature of things develops a different attitude. He comes to know that he is himself the source of all happiness, and so he has no attachment for the pleasures derived through the senses from the objective world. Knowing this, his mind naturally turns inwards into the Self. Otherwise, the mind cannot remain steady when it is pulled out by the distractions of the sense world. So, first of all, there should be a clear understanding of the ephemeral character of sense-pleasures and the pain caused by them. Then comes dispassion (vairagya) – rejection of sense-pleasures. The less is sacrificed for the greater, the transitory is sacrificed for the eternal, and reflected joy is given up for real joy. From this verse we understand three important ideas:\nHappiness is not outside. It is inside, in Atma.\nExternal pleasures are short-lived and mixed with sorrow.\nSense pleasures are obstructing the free flow of the bliss of Brahman. He who runs after them cannot experience the bliss of Brahman.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda\nSwami Vivekananda Says —\nWhere is there any enjoyment but in Him?

These same pleasures have been many times in the previous births, and they will recur many times in the future also. When X rays are focussed over the body they penetrate the outer covering and photograph the inner contents of the body. So also, the purified intellect of the spiritual seeker is able to discover the unseen germs of pain and suffering in the womb of sense-pleasures. So he shuns them like poison. They do not rejoice in them (\nna teshu remate budhah)\n. The ignorant man is attracted by the glitter and glamour of sense-pleasures, and fall into the pit of suffering. He is caught like the foolish fish that bites the flesh without seeing the hook behind.\nFrom this verse, we understand two evils arising from material pleasures 1. They contain in immense the seeds of sorrow and suffering, 2. They are short-lived, unlike that joy which is found in Atma by the man of Knowledge. The Atmic joy has not the least taint of sorrow or pain in it. It is eternal. If sense-pleasure is like a lamp, the joy of Atma is like the sun. The lamp is blown out at any time but the Sun shines forever. If sense-pleasures are like a pool, the joy of Atma is like the ocean. The pool is dried up, but not the ocean. Knowing this, the wise do not go in for material pleasures. Such one is the knowing man (\nbudhah\n.)\nIt is within the experience of every thoughtful man that the sense-pleasures corrupt the body and mind and lead to suffering and misery. The pleasures of drink, the ecstasies of lust, the adventures of gambling, the greed of accumulated wealth, the fear and glamour of position-have been the cause of ill-health, loss of vitality, bankruptcy, suicidal jealousies and hatred and all the restless passions of worldly people. Materialism, the clinging to the body as the be-all and end-all of life has destroyed mankind and deprived it of its legitimate claim to pure joy-Ananda, which is man’s birth-right. The denial of spiritual values on all sides and the consequent strife in the heart of man have rendered life for millions of people a prolonged fitful fever.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda\nSri Ramakrishna Says —\nMASTER:\n“Well, how is the doctor coming along? Does he now receive well the ideas of this place?”\nM:\n“How can an effective seed fail to sprout? It must germinate somehow or other. I feel like laughing when I remember what you said the other day.”\nMASTER:\n“What was that?”\nM:\n“You said that Jadu Mallick was so absent-minded that while taking his meals he didn’t know whether a particular dish was seasoned with salt or not. If anyone pointed out to him that a dish was not salted, he would say, in a surprised voice: ‘Yes? Yes? I see it is not salted.’ You told this to the doctor because he had said to you that he was always absent-minded. You meant that he became absent-minded thinking of worldly things and not because of contemplation of God.”\nMASTER:\n“Will he not pay attention to what I say?”\nM:\n“Of course he will. But he forgets many of your instructions because of his numerous duties. Today, too, he made a nice remark when he said, ‘To look on a woman as mother is a spiritual discipline of the Tantra.'”\nMASTER:\n“What did I say to that?”\nM:\n“You told him about that\nBhagavata\nscholar who owned bullocks and ploughs. (\nThe Master smiles\n.) Further, you told him about the king who said to the pundit of the\nBhagavata\n, ‘You had better understand it yourself first.’ (\nThe Master smiles\n.)\n“Then you told him about the Gita, whose essence is the renunciation of ‘woman and gold’, renunciation of the attachment to ‘woman and gold’.\n(\nBG 5.22\n,\nBG 5.23\n) You said to him, ‘How can a worldly man who has not renounced “woman and gold” teach others?’ Perhaps he didn’t understand the drift of your words. He changed the subject.” (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)",

    "translation": "He who is able to endure the impulse of desire and anger even in this world before the fall of the body, is the harmonised, and he is the happy man.",
    "commentary": "One major tenet of the Gita which is repeatedly affirmed by the Lord, is that the peace and happiness of spiritual life are to be attained here and now, even in this life, while living in the embodied state.The Gita, as it has been pointed out in the introduction, teaches a way of life which can be practised with advantage by the individual and by the society. What is the way to secure peace and happiness? How can man enjoy undisturbed and unbroken bliss? This question confronts everyone. Consciously or unconsciously man is seeking happiness every moment of his life; The Lord states the position with absolute clarity and perspicuity. The key to happiness is placed in one’s own hands. The mansion of peace is open to all. But one should understand what peace is and how it could be found.\nThis world and the human organism are best fitted to attain peace and Truth. This is the grandest opportunity for spiritual sadhana. The other worlds are the only places where the effects of actions done here are experienced. No sadhana is possible there. This world is the ‘Karmabhumi’. So whatever progress could be claimed by individual effort should be effected here only.\nBefore the fall of the body:\nThe idea ‘here only’ (\nihaiva\n) is elaborated by this explanatory phrase. It means before the body falls (i.e.) before death. The Lord exhorts mankind to conquer lust (Kama) and anger (Krodha) before the body falls. While living and discharging the duties and responsibilities of life, one should overcome these two fatal enemies. It is foolish to postpone the issue to a future birth. Who knows what birth one is going to have, whether that of man or beast? So this wonderful opportunity should not be lost. That which perishes is called the body –\n‘siryate iti sariram’\n. The tenure of life is uncertain. No one can say when he shall be called off from the stage of earthly life. Even if one lives up to ripe old age that will not be of much use. When the physical and mental powers are declined, what spiritual effort can one make? Sadhana will become impossible in old age. So when people are young, when the mind’s power is at its height, when the body is capable of enduring the rigours of discipline, when weakness does not set in, when the clouds of cares and anxieties do not overcast the mind, when defeatism and frustration have not knocked out the foundation of human personality – when man is young, strong, hopeful and idealistic, sadhana should be done. If one fails to do so, great difficulties would overtake him.\nAmong the six enemies, Kama, Krodha, Lobha, Moha, Mada, Matsarya, – the first two only are mentioned here. The rest are included in them. They are powerful enemies. The seeker should watch their movements with constant vigilance.",

    "translation": "He who finds happiness within, delights within, and illumined within, that sage becoming Brahman attains absolute perfection.",
    "commentary": "The highest state of Brahmanubhuti and Moksha is mentioned here. It is evident from the previous verses that all outgoing impulses should be restricted, all external pleasures given up, and all sense-enjoyments discorded before Brahman is realised. The outgoing mind should be turned inwards. Introspection, and exploration of the inner regions of the mind and its source should be cultivated and developed. This is possible only when the windows of the senses are closed, and the mind is not in contact which sense-objects. If one gives up desires, the impulses of the mind for sensual enjoyments, possessions and all external things, then will he acquire the inner vision to see the Self and abide in it.\nFinds happiness within:\nThe common man cannot find the happiness of the Self within. He imagines that he is deriving happiness from external objects. The truth is that all happiness is only in the Self, and what one thinks as happiness coming from outside is only the reflected happiness (Ananda) of the Self. The pleasures of the senses are short-lived, and contain in themselves the germs of pain and sorrow. To know this is very difficult, and man errs repeatedly. And yet the time should come when he realises the foolishness of running after silly sensual pleasures, and then the march back to his original state begins. When he finds the inner source of untainted happiness, he never again enters the sense-world.\nRejoices within:\nThe world is the playground of the senses and the mind. But the wise finds that the so-called enjoyments and pleasures are unreal and short-lived. So he goes into himself and is delighted with the pure joy of the Self. There he finds the full realisation of all conceivable pleasures in the one joy of the Self. He forever delights within himself.\nIlluminated within:\nThe senses function by the external light of the Sun and the Moon. Without it, the world is a dark mass. But the Sun himself shines by the light of Atma.\nThe whole universe shines by the light of Atma. The eye is illumined by the intellect, and the intellect is illumined by Atma. It is Atma that is revealing itself as the diverse manifestations of light in the universe. Knowing this, the sage is illumined by Atma, the source of all light everywhere. He is light, and the light is within.\nIn this way, abandoning all the deluded attachment for the objective world, realising Atma as the foundation of all bliss, and the source of all light, meditating on That, the wise man becomes one with Brahman and attains Moksha.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda",

    "commentary": "Who is a Rishi? One who has mastered the senses and mind, who is established in Atma is a Rishi. It is a position, a title, that anyone can acquire by tapas. It is something like a degree which young students acquire after going through a particular course of study. So, anyone endowed with character and singleness of purpose can obtain the title of a Rishi. No one is precluded from making the attempt. The ignorant man of today may become the sage of the future.\nConstant sadhana transforms the common human being into a sage of wisdom, world-honoured and one with God Himself.\n(Brahmavit Brahmaiva bhavati). Four characteristics of the sage are mentioned here.\nWhose sins are destroyed:\nIn the course of innumerable births man may have committed a number of sins prohibited by the Sastras, e.g. – theft, drunkenness, adultery, murder etc. So the mind is full of impurities. These should be destroyed by Nishkama Karma, devotion and Knowledge. Then the very sinner becomes a sage.\nWhose dualities are torn asunder:\nThe illusion of manifoldness should be transcended by the perception of unity in all things. All doubts would be cleared when the Reality is seen as it is.\nSelf-controlled:\nThe Rishi has mastered all impulses and powers of the body, mind and intellect. Perfect self-control is the only way to Self-realisation.\nRejoicing in the welfare of all beings:\nWhat is the effect of Brahma Jnana? – universal love. Knowledge in action is love. The sage knows that there is only one Supreme Self, and that is manifesting as the many. The same Self that is in him is also in everything. When one realises this truth, what will be his attitude towards other beings? – Love for all. He cannot injure others, he cannot be jealous of others. He has no fear of anything. The ‘others’ do not exist for him, because he has perceived the unity of all beings, and he is himself the all. The test of man’s wisdom is here. He is full of compassion. His heart overflows with pity. When the sage moves in the world, the one attribute of the purified heart would be love. God is worshipped not only as the All-powerful but as the All-merciful. God is love. Great sages have preached and practised universal love as the highest law for humanity.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda\nRelated Articles:\nThose who,\nhaving restrained well all the senses\n,\neven-minded everywhere\n,\nrejoicing in the welfare of all beings\n, meditate on the indefinable, eternal, all-pervading, and Imperishable Brahman – they attain Me alone.

    "translation": "To the self-controlled sages who are free from desire and wrath, who have controlled their thoughts, who have realised the Self, absolute freedom exists on all sides.",
    "commentary": "Three important qualities of the sage are mentioned here:\nAbandoning of desire and anger (i.e.). destruction of all tendencies (vasanakshaya).\nControl of mind (i.e.) destruction of the mind (manonasa).\nKnowledge of Atma (tattvajnana).\nThe sage with these three qualities enjoys the bliss of absolute freedom at all times, in all places, and under all circumstances. By the Knowledge of Atma, all the tendencies (samskaras) of the mind are removed, and the mind becomes non-existent. Moksha is not for the idle and lethargic. Hence the word\n‘Yati’\nis used here.\n‘Yati’\nmeans one who sacrifices everything for a great ideal. The ideal of realisation is achieved only by a great deal of effort. So having faith in the words of the Sastras and the Guru, let the seeker strive for the speedy realisation of spiritual freedom.\nConstant meditation on Atma – the pure and perfect, will gradually purify the mind of all its evil samskaras. By knowing firmly that the objective world (drisya) is unreal, man overcomes the temptation for sense-pleasures and the consequent agitations of desire and anger.\nThe mind is impure as it has absorbed all evil tendencies through a number of births in a state of ignorance. The fire of Knowledge should burn up these tendencies and purify the mind which usually functions in tamas and rajas. Pure sattva is to be acquired by Knowledge of Atma. The mind is the axle on which the vast machine of samsara rotates endlessly. When the mind moves, the world moves. When the mind is not, the world is not. The impure mind sees the world as a vast battle-field of conflicting passions. The purified mind sees it as Atma. The devotee sees the world as the Lord. So the mind should be purified and kept under control by knowing that which is beyond it. Atmajnana implies a deep enquiry into the real nature of man. By such internal investigation, one comes to understand that he is not the body, the senses, the mind and the intellect, but that he is the one ‘Self’, the Drik, pure Knowledge. The seeker should constantly hold on to the reality, which is pure and changeless, knowing by direct experience that what changes is only the picture of the world.\nIt has already been said that when a man attains “Brahmisthiti’, he does not fall into delusion again. Hence it is declared that the man who attains ‘Brahma nirvanam’ exists in a state of absolute freedom and bliss at all times, in all places, under all circumstances. He is liberated when he holds the body or drops it. He lives always in freedom.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda\nSri Ramakrishna Says —\nA BRAHMO DEVOTEE:\n“How can one realise God?”\nMASTER:\n“By directing your love to Him and constantly reasoning that God alone is real and the world illusory. The aswattha tree alone is permanent; its fruit is transitory.”\nBRAHMO:\n“We have passions like anger and lust. What shall we do with these?”\nMASTER:\n“Direct the six passions to God. The impulse of\nlust\nshould be turned into the desire to have intercourse with Atman. Feel\nangry\nat those who stand in your way to God. Feel\ngreedy\nfor Him. If you must have the feeling of I and mine, then associate it with God. Say, for instance, ‘My Rama, my Krishna.’ If you must have\npride\n, then feel like Bibhishana, who said, ‘I have touched the feet of Rama with my head; I will not bow this head before anyone else.'”\n(\nBG 2.59\n,\nBG 5.26\n,\nSvetasvatara Upanishad 2.3\n)\nBRAHMO:\n“If it is God that makes me do everything, then I am not responsible for my sins.”\nMASTER (\nwith a smile\n):\n“Yes, Duryodhana also said that. ‘O Krishna, I do what Thou, seated in my heart, makest me do.’\nIf a man has the firm conviction that God alone is the Doer and he is His instrument, then he cannot do anything sinful. He who has learnt to dance correctly never makes a false step. One cannot even believe in the existence of God until one’s heart becomes pure.\n“\nSri Ramakrishna looked at the devotees assembled in the worship hall and said: “It is very good to gather in this way, now and then, and think of God and sing His name and glories. But the worldly man’s yearning for God is momentary. It lasts as long as a drop of water on a red-hot frying-pan.” (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)",

    "commentary": "It is stated here that he who knows the Lord (Atma) attains peace. Three attributes of the Lord are mentioned here.\nGod is described as the enjoyer of the fruits of all sacrifices and austerities performed by men. God is all-pervading and so He is the inner power of all beings. Consequently, he is the enjoyer of the fruits of all the meritorious work done by man.\nGod is the supreme Lord of all the worlds. There is no power higher or equal to Him.\nFriend of all beings:\nThough He is the Lord and Controller of all the worlds, He is the greatest friend of all beings. A friend is one who does good to another without expecting any return. What does God require of man? Nothing. And yet He is full of love for man and acts like the greatest friend and benefactor. The very fact that He directly teaches the wisdom of the Gita to man-kind is the proof of His compassion for suffering humanity. If one enquires into the nature of man and the universe around him, he would understand the infinite compassion of the Lord and his ceaseless endeavour to do the highest good to all beings.\nThe seeker who understands God in this way attains peace. Everyone is seeking peace. Here is the easy path of devotion to the Lord, which leads to peace and freedom. One should try to understand the attributes of God to know Him intimately. This confirms and strengthens his devotion. When the Lord says that He is a friend (\nsuhrit\n) of all beings, it would be sufficient to think of him as the nearest and dearest companion, on whom one can depend for help and guidance in his sadhana.\nMan has degraded himself by his lack of faith in the Lord. This is the main cause of unrest in the world. Men run hither and thither begging for small rewards from people holding small material authority. The Lord who is the King of Kings, who is the repository of all power and blessedness, by whose power the Sun shines and the winds blow, is forgotten by ignorant man. Saints and sages have proclaimed in one voice the immediate presence of God everywhere, and yet their words do not carry any weight with him. People have made themselves so low and weak that they put their faith in common mortals who are subject to all personal weaknesses. Let people understand that the Lord is the supreme friend of all. By devotion to Him, man attains peace.\nOne should note here that the whole Discourse is based on the principles of self-control, enquiry into the Self. Knowledge of Atma is emphasised over and over, and yet in this closing Verse, the Lord strikes the note of devotion (bhakti) and intimacy with God as a friend as the way to peace. By the grace of God alone, it is possible for man to cross the mire of delusion, and establish his oneness with the Supreme Reality (Brahman).\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda",
