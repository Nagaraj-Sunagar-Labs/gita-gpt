    "translation": "The Lord said: To you, free from malice and cavil, I shall declare this profoundest secret, knowledge with experience combined, which having known, you shall be freed from all evil.",
    "commentary": "The Lord now teaches the highest knowledge (\nAtmajnana\n) and the profoundest secret (\nrajaguhyam\n) combined with direct practical experience. The word ‘guhyatamam’ indicates that the knowledge is the highest secret, beyond which there is nothing else to be known. The teaching of Brahmajnana is usually done to those who are qualified to receive it, or even to hear of it. What is that quality which entitles a person to hear and understand Brahmatatvam? The Lord answers it here by stating that Arjuna is free from malice (\nasuya\n). He is pure in heart and has the four qualities mentioned in the Sastras (\nsadhana chatushtaya\n). So the Lord reveals the supreme knowledge. Those who are eager to receive the knowledge from a Guru should first of all examine themselves and know fully well whether they are established in virtue and self-control. Brahmajnana will never reveal itself in the impure heart, whatever other things one may possess, power or position. These things do not qualify anyone to understand the Truth. The pure soul knows the secret and attains Brahman.\nHe who does not indulge in misrepresenting good to be bad, who commends even low forms of goodness in others, who does not delight in thinking of the evil in others in anasuya. Of all the host of bad qualities, envy is the leader. Like poisonous cancer, it permeates the whole mind, and pulls down the sadhaka from any merit which he might have acquired by austerity. Several aspirants have fallen on account of this evil. The Lord understands human nature so well that he fixes attention on that one evil which is the source of all other evils. He knows that the disciple is free from this evil, and so, he reveals the profoundest secret to him in perfect confidence. Every disciple should impress his Guru about the purity of the heart, and only then would the Guru teach the highest knowledge. The purer you are, the greater would be the confidence of the Guru in you. Such mutual understanding is necessary for transmitting Atmajnana.\nJnanam Vignanasahitam:\nThe word\njnanam\nstands for knowledge obtained by the study of the Sastras. This knowledge is indirect (paroksha). Vijnana means direct experience (aparoksha). When one hears of a country from a friend or reads of it in a book, his knowledge of the country is indirect (Paroksha) but when he visits the country and sees it for himself, his knowledge is direct (Aparoksha). Such is the difference between Jnana and Vijnana.\nWhat is the fruit of Vijnana? The Lord says he who knows the truth directly is freed from all evil. What is this evil? It is samsara – the cycle of birth and death, with all the ills and sorrows of one’s ignorant life. Whatever is anatma comes under the delusive power of Maya. It is transient, incomplete, insipid, and appears to exist without any reality in it. Atma alone is\nsubha\n(without evil). It is deathless, birthless, ever blessed, and blissful. So every seeker should follow the teaching of the Lord and rise to the plane of Atma.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda\nRelated Articles:\nKnowing which there shall not be any other to be known in this world, that\nKnowledge combined with experience\n, I will tell you.

    "translation": "It is the sovereign science, the sovereign mystery, and the supreme purifier. It is perceived by direct experience, it accords with dharma, it is easy to practise, and it is imperishable.",
    "commentary": "All other sciences cannot bestow peace and bliss on mankind. Worldly knowledge can only deal with material things which are perishable. The profound mystery of life and death and immortality can be understood only when Brahman is realised. All other things are ‘anatma’, ‘jada’, insentient. They are impure. Atma the self, Brahman alone is pure and perfect. So this knowledge which reveals the ultimate Truth is declared to be royal knowledge and royal secret.\nThis royal knowledge is to be attained by direct intuition. Its fruit is direct and immediate. All other works take time to bear fruit. But Brahmajnana bears fruit at once and the sage of realisation becomes Brahman, is Brahman immediately.\nIt is declared here that the practice of Brahmajnana is very easy. When the mind is purified by self-effort of all its impurities like raga and dvesha, tamas and rajas no further effort is needed for the realisation of Brahman, because Brahman is self-existent and self-luminous. There is no effort needed to realise the truth. So it is said in the sastras that Brahmajnana is easier than crushing the tender flowers or easier than ordinary respiration. This is not only very easy to practice but it is also the source of all Dharma, eternal, and imperishable.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda",

    "translation": "People who have no faith in this dharma are unable to attain Me, O conqueror of enemies. They repeatedly come back to this world in the cycle of birth and death.",
    "commentary": "Whether in worldly or spiritual life, faith and devotion to an ideal is the key to success. The degree of success depends on the intensity of one’s faith. Man becomes that which he aims at, the time taken depending on the intensity of the effort, and the strength of the obstructing forces. Sooner or later, it is certain that man achieves what he yearns for with single-minded devotion.\nThe Lord declares here that without faith no one could attain Him, and without attaining Him no one can get immortality. Let the seekers understand that much diligence is needed even in small things and common affairs of life. This being so, one can understand what care and caution are needed to realise the highest state. So, the Lord emphasises the efficacy of faith throughout His teaching.\nAccording to the Lord, this Samsara is a world of death. Death is stalking everywhere and yet blinded by the veil of avidya, man imagines that life is beautiful and pleasant. He has missed the true end of life. He has bartered away his birthright of immortality and eternal bliss to a mess of pottage. The Lord knows this, and out of compassion, he warns mankind not to come under the shadow of death and destruction. Without understanding the Truth, whatever other enjoyments man may try to have, all these are only the decoration of a corpse. The wise shall strive to know the Lord and transcend the ills of life and death.\nThe word ‘\nnivartante\n‘ may also be interpreted as Nitaram Vartante (i.e) assuredly pass through the path of death.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda",

    "translation": "This entire cosmic manifestation is pervaded by Me in My unmanifest form. All living beings dwell in Me, but I do not dwell in them.",
    "commentary": "Paramatma is inconceivable by the senses and the mind. Even the elemental ether is not visible to the senses. How then can the chidakasa, the intelligence – consciousness (God) be an object of sense-perception? Just as the material world is pervaded by the elemental ether, even so by that supreme intelligence (chit) all beings are pervaded. So the whole universe is in Paramatma.\nThe Lord is not placed in the world, because when closely examined, the world has no existence like the snake which is superimposed on the rope. How can paramatma, the reality, exist in that unreality – the so-called world as we see it? So, it is said that all beings are in Atma (the Lord) and He is not in them.\nAs the Lord pervades all beings, material and mental the seeker should cognise His existence everywhere. He should not do evil deeds, should have love for all, and devotion to the Supreme.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda\nSri Ramakrishna Says —\nWater and a bubble on it are one and the same. The bubble has its birth in the water, floats on it, and is ultimately resolved into it. So also the Jivatman and the Paramatman are one and the same, the difference between them being only one of degree. For one is finite and limited while the other is infinite; one is dependent while the other is independent.\n(Source: The Sayings of Sri Ramakrishna)\n—–\nANOTHER DEVOTEE:\n“Sir, to see you is the same as to see God.”\nMASTER:\n“Don’t ever say that again.\nThe waves belong to the Ganges, not the Ganges to the waves.\nA man cannot realise God unless he gets rid of all such egotistic ideas as ‘I am such an important man’ or ‘I am so and so’. Level the mound of ‘I’ to the ground by dissolving it with tears of devotion.” (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\n—–\nIshan intended to retire to a solitary place and practise a special discipline of the Gayatri, through which Brahman is invoked. But the Master said that the Knowledge of Brahman was not possible without the complete destruction of worldliness. Further, he said that it was impossible for a man totally to withdraw his mind from the objects of the senses in the Kaliyuga, when his life was dependent on food. That is why the Master discouraged people from attempting the Vedic worship of Brahman and asked them to worship Sakti, the Divine Mother, who is identical with Brahman.\nMASTER (to Ishan):\n“Why do you waste your time simply repeating ‘Neti, neti’? Nothing whatsoever can be specified about Brahman, except that It exists.\n“Whatever we see or think about is the manifestation of the glory of the Primordial Energy, the Primal Consciousness. Creation, preservation, and destruction, living beings and the universe, and further, meditation and the meditator, bhakti and prema — all these are manifestations of the glory of that Power.\n“But Brahman is identical with Its Power. On returning from Ceylon, Hanuman praised Rama, saying: ‘O Rama, You are the Supreme Brahman, and Sita is Your Sakti. You and She are identical.’ Brahman and Sakti are like the snake and its wriggling motion. Thinking of the snake, one must think of its wriggling motion, and thinking of its wriggling motion, one must think of the snake. Or they are like milk and its whiteness. Thinking of milk, one has to think of its colour, that is, whiteness, and thinking of the whiteness of milk, one has to think of milk itself. Or they are like water and its wetness. Thinking of water, one has to think of its wetness, and thinking of the wetness of water, one has to think of water.\n“This Primal Power, Mahamaya, has covered Brahman. As soon as the covering is withdrawn, one realises: ‘I am what I was before’, ‘I am Thou; Thou art I’.\n“As long as that covering remains, the Vedantic formula ‘I am He’, that is, man is the Supreme Brahman, does not rightly apply.\nThe wave is part of the water, but the water is not part of the wave.\nAs long as that covering remains, one should call on God as Mother. Addressing God, the devotee should say, ‘Thou art the Mother and I am Thy child; Thou art the Master and I am Thy servant.’ It is good to have the attitude of the servant toward the master. From this relationship of master and servant spring up other attitudes: the attitude of serene love for God, the attitude of friend toward friend, and so forth. When the master loves his servant, he may say to him, ‘Come, sit by my side; there is no difference between you and me.’ But if the servant comes forward of his own will to sit by the master, will not the master be angry?\n“God’s play on earth as an Incarnation is the manifestation of the glory of the Chitsakti, the Divine Power. That which is Brahman is also Rama, Krishna, and Siva.”\nISHAN:\n“Yes, sir. Both Hari and Hara are derived from the same root. The difference lies only in the pratyaya.”\nMASTER:\n“Yes, there is only One without a second. The Vedas speak-of It as ‘Om Satchidananda Brahma’, the Puranas as ‘Om Satchidananda Krishna’, and the Tantra as ‘Om Satchidananda Siva’.\n“The Chitsakti, as Mahamaya, has deluded all with ignorance. It is said in the Adhyatma Ramayana that when the rishis saw Rama, they prayed to Him in these words only: ‘O Rama, please do not delude us with Your world-bewitching maya.'” (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\n—–\nMASTER:\n“Pray to God. He is full of compassion. Will He not listen to the words of His devotee? He is the Kalpataru. You will get whatever you desire from Him.”\nPUNDIT:\n“I haven’t thought deeply about these things before. But now I understand.”\nMASTER:\n“God keeps a little of ‘I’ in His devotee even after giving him the Knowledge of Brahman. That ‘I’ is the ‘I of the devotee’, the ‘I of the jnani’. Through that ‘I’ the devotee enjoys the infinite play of God.\n“The pestle\n7\nwas almost worn out with rubbing. Only a little was left. That fell into the underbrush and brought about the destruction of the lunar race, the race of the Yadus. The vijnani retains the ‘I of the devotee’, the ‘I of the jnani’, in order to taste the Bliss of God and teach people.\n“The rishis of old had timid natures. They were easily frightened. Do you know their attitude? It was this: ‘Let me somehow get my own salvation; who cares for others?’ A hollow piece of drift-wood somehow manages to float; but it sinks if even a bird sits on it. But Narada and sages of his kind are like a huge log that not only can float across to the other shore but can carry many animals and other creatures as well. A steamship itself crosses the ocean and also carries people across.\n“Teachers like Narada belong to the class of the vijnani. They were much more courageous than the other rishis. They are like an expert satrancha-player. You must have noticed how he shouts, as he throws the dice: “What do I want? Six? No, five! Here is five!’ And every time he throws the dice he gets the number he wants. He is such a clever player! And while playing he even twirls his moustaches.\n“A mere jnani trembles with fear. He is like an amateur satrancha-player; He is anxious to move his pieces somehow to the safety zone, where they won’t be overtaken by his opponent. But a vijnani isn’t afraid of anything. He has realised both aspects of God: Personal and Impersonal. He has talked with God. He has enjoyed the Bliss of God.\n“It is a joy to merge the mind in the Indivisible Brahman through contemplation. And it is also a joy to keep the mind on the Lila, the Relative, without dissolving it in the Absolute.\n“A mere jnani is a monotonous person. He always analyses, saying: ‘It is not this, not this. The world is like a dream.’ But I have ‘raised both my hands’. Therefore I accept everything.\n“Listen to a story. Once a woman went to see her weaver friend. The weaver, who had been spinning different kinds of silk thread, was very happy to see her friend and said to her: ‘Friend, I can’t tell you how happy I am to see you. Let me get you some refreshments.’ She left the room. The woman looked at the threads of different colours and was tempted. She hid a bundle of thread under one arm. The weaver returned presently with the refreshments and began to feed her guest with great enthusiasm. But, looking at the thread, she realised that her friend had taken a bundle. Hitting upon a plan to get it back, she said: ‘Friend, it is so long since I have seen you. This is a day of great joy for me. I feel very much like asking you to dance with me.’ The friend said, ‘Sister, I am feeling very happy too.’ So the two friends began to dance together. When the weaver saw that her friend danced without raising her hands, she said: ‘Friend, let us dance with both hands raised. This is a day of great joy.’ But the guest pressed one arm to her side and danced raising only the other. The weaver said: ‘How is this, friend? Why should you dance, with only one hand raised? Dance with me raising both hands. Look at me. See how I dance with both hands raised.’ But the guest still pressed one arm to her side. She danced with the other hand raised and said with a smile, ‘This is all I know of dancing.'”\nThe Master continued:\n“I don’t press my arm to my side. Both my hands are free. I am not afraid of anything. I accept both the Nitya and the Lila, both the Absolute and the Relative.\n“I said to Keshab Sen that he would not be able to realise God without renouncing the ego. He said, ‘Sir, in that case I should not be able to keep my organization together.’ Thereupon I said to him: ‘I am asking you to give up the “unripe ego”, the “wicked ego”. But there is no harm in the “ripe ego”, the “child ego”, the “servant ego”, the “ego of Knowledge”.’\n“The worldly man’s ego, the ‘ignorant ego’, the ‘unripe ego’, is like a thick stick. It divides, as it were, the water of the Ocean of Satchidananda. But the ‘servant ego’, the ‘child ego’, the ‘ego of Knowledge’, is like a line on the water. One clearly sees that there is only one expanse of water. The dividing line makes it appear that the water has two parts, but one clearly sees that in reality there is only one expanse of water.\n“Sankaracharya kept the ‘ego of Knowledge’ in order to teach people. God keeps in many people the ‘ego of a jnani’ or the ‘ego of a bhakta’ even after they have attained Brahmajnana. Hanuman, after realizing God in both His Personal and His Impersonal aspect, cherished toward God the attitude of a servant, a devotee. He said to Rama: ‘O Rama, sometimes I think that You are the whole and I am a part of You. Sometimes I think that You are the Master and I am Your servant. And sometimes, Rama, when I contemplate the Absolute, I see that I am You and You are I.’\n“Yasoda became grief-stricken at being separated from Krishna, and called on Radha. Radha saw Yasoda’s suffering and revealed herself to her as the divine Sakti, which was her real nature. She said to Yasoda: ‘Krishna is Chidatma, Absolute Consciousness, and I am Chitsakti, the Primal Power. Ask a boon of Me.’ Yasoda said: ‘I don’t want Brahmajnana. Please grant me only this; that I may see the form of Gopala in my meditation; that I may always have the company of Krishna’s devotees; that I may always serve the devotees of God; that I may always chant God’s name and glories.’\n“Once the gopis felt a great desire to see the forms of the Lord. So Krishna asked them to dive into the water of the Jamuna. No sooner did they dive into the water than they all arrived at Vaikuntha. There they saw the form of the Lord endowed with His six celestial splendours. But they did not like it. They said to Krishna: ‘We want to see Gopala and serve Him. Please grant us that boon alone. We don’t want anything else.’\n“Before His departure for Mathura, Krishna wanted to give the Knowledge of Brahman to the gopis. He said to them:\n‘I dwell both inside and outside all beings. Why should you see only one form of Mine?’\n(Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\nRelated Articles:\nAll beings are unmanifest in their beginning, O Bhārata, manifest in their middle state, and unmanifest again in their end. Why, then, lament for them? (\nBG 2.28\n)\nThere is no end of My divine manifestations, Ο dreaded Arjuna. This is but a partial statement by Me of the multiplicity of My attributes. (\nBG 10.40\n)",

    "commentary": "There appears to be an apparent contradiction. In the previous\nverse\n, it was declared that all beings are in the Lord. Here it is stated that the beings also are not in Him. The contradiction is only apparent and not real. From the point of view of the ignorant, the world has an existence, as it is touched and confirmed by the senses. So it is said to exist in, and sustained by Paramatma. From the Advaitic plane, the world does not exist at all, in the same manner as water does not exist in the mirage. So it is said here that the beings also do not exist in Him. This is from the pure Advaitic point of view, where there is only one undifferentiated eternal Brahman, and nothing else. The Lord’s declaration means that Drisya the seen world does not exist in Him, or He in Drisya. The man who has awakended from the dream comes to know that he never existed in the dream nor the dream in him. It is nothing. The man who saw the snake in the rope, when he comes to know the form of the rope, knows that snake did not and does not exist. Thus, there are no beings in the Lord, nor He in them. What existed, exists, and shall exist is Paramatma alone. This is the sovereign yoga of the Lord. The cosmic illusion appears to exist but really does not exist. So the world while appearing to exist, does not exist. All this is Brahman and nothing else. This is the royal secret.\nSwami Chetanananda",

    "translation": "Know that as the mighty wind blowing everywhere rests always in the sky(ether), likewise, all living beings always rest in Me.",
    "commentary": "The Lord gives a beautiful simile to explain what He has said in the previous two verses. Just as the mighty wind rests in the ether which has no contact with the wind, so also all beings rest in Brahman, who is not contaminated by them at all. The objects cannot produce any effect on Him. The mighty wind rests in some part of the elemental ether. So also, the whole universe is in some spot in the supreme Brahman. The wind may carry good or foul smell, may be gentle or strong, but ether is not affected by it. So also, the good and bad in man or the actions taking place in the world do not effect Brahman. Ether cannot be seen, so also Paramatma; ether is subtle, Paramatma is more subtle; ether pervades all, so also, Paramatma pervades all beings. This illustration of ether and the wind resting in it is intended for the understanding of the common people only. In fact, ether cannot be compared to Paramatma, because ether is insentient and Paramatma on the other hand is supreme consciousness.\nThe immediate and direct presence of Paramatma is to be realised everywhere and in everything. He is in every particle of the universe. Knowing this, can a man commit sin? Paramatma is the eternal witness of all. The supremacy of Paramatma is clearly to be understood because in Him is the whole of this wonderful universe. Let not man be imbued with pride and arrogance for the little strength or power or position or beauty or talent that he may possess for a short while.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda",

It is She alone who is known as Maha-Kali, Nitya-Kali, Smasana-Kali, Raksha-Kali, and Syama-Kali. Maha-Kali and Nitya-Kali are mentioned in the Tantra philosophy. When there were neither the creation, nor the sun, the moon, the planets, and the earth, and when darkness was enveloped in darkness, then the Mother, the Formless One, Maha-Kali, the Great Power, was one with Maha-Kala, the Absolute.\n…. “After the destruction of the universe, at the end of a great cycle, the Divine Mother garners the seeds for the next creation: She is like the elderly mistress of the house, who has a hotchpotch-pot in which she keeps different articles for household use. (\nAll laugh\n.)\n“Oh, yes! Housewives have pots like that, where they keep ‘sea-foam’, (The Master perhaps referred to the cuttlefish bone found on the seashore. The popular belief is that it is hardened sea-foam.) blue pills, small bundles of seeds of cucumber, pumpkin, and gourd, and so on. They take them out when they want them.\nIn the same way, after the destruction of the universe, my Divine Mother, the Embodiment of Brahman, gathers together the seeds for the next creation. After the creation the Primal Power dwells in the universe itself. She brings forth this phenomenal world and then pervades it. In the Vedas creation is likened to the spider and its web. The spider brings the web out of itself and then remains in it. God is the container of the universe and also what is contained in it.\n(Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\nRelated Articles:\nAs the spider sends forth and draws in its thread, as plants grow on the earth, as hair grows on the head and the body of a living man-so does everything in the universe arise from the Imperishable. (\nMundaka Upanishad 1.1.7\n)",

    "translation": "Controlling My own Prakriti, I send forth, again and again, all this multitude of beings, helpless under the sway of māyā.",
    "commentary": "The difference between Jiva and Isvara is clearly brought forth here. The Jiva is helpless by the force of Nature. Isvara is the controller of Nature. The Jiva is bound by the actions which he does by the force of Nature. All beings come under the power of nature, except those who have gone beyond Nature and reached the ultimate Paramatma. The Jivanmuktas have gone beyond Maya. Nature has no power over them. All other beings come out and go back into Nature endlessly and suffer all the ills and troubles of life and death.\nSo, it is the duty of every man to purify his own nature which expresses itself in different sensual thoughts and acts by the force of the gunas –\ntamas\nand\nrajas\n. Slavery to the gunas continues till one transcends them and rises to the plane of pure\nsattva\n. As the Lord has declared already, those who take refuge in Him easily cross over Maya and reach Him.\nAs persons sitting on the wheel that rotates, rotate till the owner of the wheel stops it, so also, all men are bound to the wheel of life and death, till God stops the wheel for those who seek His grace.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda\n—\nThe Master showered his grace on Girish Chandra Ghosh and even on many prostitutes. One day the ladies of Balaram Babu’s family were sitting before the Master in his room when a prostitute named Ramani passed along the road nearby. The Master called to her and asked, “Why don’t you come nowadays?” The ladies were scandalized to hear the Master talking with a prostitute.\nShortly afterwards the Master took them to visit the shrines. When they reached the Kali temple the Master said to the Divine Mother:\n“Mother, Thou indeed hast become the prostitute Ramani. Thou hast become both the prostitute and the chaste woman!”\nThe ladies understood that they were wrong in despising Ramani, and that the Master spoke with her, knowing her to be the Mother Herself. They should not be so proud of their chastity, for it was all due to the Mother’s will.\n— Sri Ramakrishna (Source: Ramakrishna as We Saw Him)",

    "commentary": "Prakriti is Jada insentient; Paramatma is consciousness. By the immediate presence of Paramatma, Prakriti produces the entire universe. In the vicinity of a magnet, the iron needle moves. The magnet has no particular agency in this. It is just where it is. This Paramatma is in the universe like an unconcerned entity Udasina. But His immediate proximity enables Prakriti to create things. The word adhyakshena is used here to indicate the non-attachment and the consciousness – Principle of the Lord. An assembly, so to say, has no life till the president takes the chair. A Court, so to say, has no life till the judge takes his seat. When he takes the seat, the whole assembly is animated with life and goes into action. So also, Prakriti remains inert till it is animated by the presence of the Lord and brings forth the whole universe. Without Him, the universe would simply be inert matter and nothing more.\nWe may take the illustration of the Sun. As the Sun rises in the east, each man wakes up and carries on his work, whatever it may be. Good people do good work and bad people do bad work. The Sun has nothing to do with their nature or their actions.\nThe material world is inert. It has no life or activity by itself. What gives life to it is the Supreme Consciousness – Principle of the Lord Himself. This is not visible to the gross vision. It is the eye of Knowledge that sees it. That is Paramatma. The whole world is super-imposed on the Lord who is the basic adhishtana (support). What is super-imposed (\naropitam\n) cannot be different from the original (\nadhishtana\n). All the powers that we see exhibited in the universe are derived from the Lord. And yet the Lord is in no way concerned with or affected by the actions of people in the world. The physical and the mental forces are only the grosser manifestation of the Atmic power of the Lord, which is the one power from which all others are produced by Prakriti. The wise man should not be deceived or destroyed by the temptations of the little force or power that he may have in him. He should know that, small or great, the power is the Lord’s and not his own. All the various forms of Cosmic energy, such as matter, thought, force, intelligence and so forth, are simply the manifestation of the Cosmic intelligence the Supreme Lord.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda\nSwami Vivekananda Says —\nWhat then is this Purusha? It is neither intelligence nor will, but it is the cause of all these. It is its presence that sets them all going and combining. It does not mix with nature; it is not intelligence, or Mahat; but the Self, the pure, is Purusha. “I am the witness, and through my witnessing, nature is producing all that is sentient and all that is insentient.”\n[Source]",

    "commentary": "Paramatma is the controller of all beings. He is the Lord, Isvara. He has already declared that, though he has no birth, he appears to be born in the world for the purpose of establishing Dharma and protecting the righteous. When he assumes the human form, the deluded disregard Him as no more than other mortals. There are some people proud of their position and wealth, ill-treating and abusing saints and sadhus. As the saints and sadhus are devoid of worldly goods like wealth and position, some people show no respect for them. The Bhakta and Bhagavan are one. The Lord is present in His devotees and they have to be honoured as such. Sisupala and Duryodhana never understood the Divine nature of Lord Krishna. It was only Bhishma and a few others who recognised the Divinity of Krishna.\nThose who are engaged in spritual practice should be careful about the wrong view and opinions expressed by the common people. Honour and dishonour come to them, honour from the wise and dishonour from the unwise. In such situations, the seeker has to be firm and steady, and not yield to the common reactions of elation and anger. Let the seeker avoid the company of those who deny God, and abuse sages and saints. By his own elevated thoughts and actions, he should set an example of purity and godliness to others.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda\nSwami Vivekananda Says —\nGod understands human failings and becomes man to do good to humanity: “Whenever virtue subsides and wickedness prevails, I manifest Myself. To establish virtue, to destroy evil, to save the good I come from yuga (age) to yuga.” “Fools deride Me who have assumed the human form, without knowing My real nature as the Lord of the universe.” Such is Shri Krishna’s declaration in the Gita on Incarnation. “When a huge tidal wave comes,” says Bhagavan Shri Ramakrishna, “all the little brooks and ditches become full to the brim without any effort or consciousness on their own part; so when an Incarnation comes, a tidal wave of spirituality breaks upon the world, and people feel spirituality almost full in the air.”\n[Source]\nHe also says, “Fools, not knowing that I, the Omnipotent and Omnipresent God of the universe, have taken this human form, deride Me and think that cannot be.” Their minds have been clouded with demoniacal ignorance, so they cannot see in Him the Lord of the universe. These great Incarnations of God are to be worshipped. Not only so, they alone can be worshipped; and on the days of their birth, and on the days when they went out of this world, we ought to pay more particular reverence to them. In worshipping Christ I would rather worship Him just as He desires; on the day of His birth I would rather worship him by fasting than by feasting — by praying. When these are thought of, these great ones, they manifest themselves in our souls, and they make us like unto them. Our whole nature changes, and we become like them.\n[Source]\nSri Ramakrishna Says —\n“It is very difficult to understand that God can be a finite human being and at the same time the all-pervading Soul of the universe. The Absolute and the Relative are His two aspects. How can we say emphatically with our small intelligence that God cannot assume a human form? Can we ever understand all these ideas with our little intellect? Can a one-seer pot hold four seers of milk?\n(Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\n—\n“Ordinary people do not recognize the advent of an Incarnation of God. He comes in secret. Only a few of His intimate disciples can recognize Him. That Rama was both Brahman Absolute and a perfect Incarnation of God in human form was known only to twelve rishis. The other sages said to Him, ‘Rama, we know You only as Dasaratha’s son.’\n“Can everyone comprehend Brahman, the Indivisible Existence-Knowledge-Bliss Absolute?\nHe alone has attained perfect love of God who, having reached the Absolute, keeps himself in the realm of the Relative in order to enjoy the divine lila.\nA man can describe the ways and activities of the Queen (Queen Victoria.) if he has previously visited her in England. Only then will his description of the Queen be correct. Sages like Bharadvaja adored Rama and said: ‘O Rama, You are nothing but the Indivisible Satchidananda. You have appeared before us as a human being, but You look like a man because You have shrouded Yourself with Your own maya.’ These rishis were great devotees of Rama and had supreme love for God.”\n(Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\n—–\n“God, incarnating Himself as man, behaves exactly like a man. That is why it is difficult to recognize an Incarnation. When God becomes man, He is exactly like man. He has the same hunger, thirst, disease, grief, and sometimes even fear. Rama was stricken with grief for Sita. Krishna carried on His head the shoes and wooden stool of His father Nanda.\n“In the theatre, when an actor comes on the stage in the role of a holy man, he behaves like one, and not like the actor who is taking the part of the king. He plays his own role.\n“Once an impersonator dressed himself as a world-renouncing monk. Pleased with the correctness of his disguise, some rich people offered him a rupee. He did not accept the money but went away shaking his head. Afterwards he removed his disguise and appeared in his usual dress. Then he said to the rich people, ‘Please give me the rupee.’ They replied: ‘Why, you went away refusing our present. Why do you ask for it now?’ The man said: ‘But then I was in the role of a holy man. I could not accept money.’ Likewise, when God becomes man He behaves exactly like a man. (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\n—–\nMASTER:\n“Nothing is impossible for God. Nobody can describe His nature in words. Everything is possible for Him. There lived at a certain place two yogis who were practising spiritual discipline. The sage Narada was passing that way one day. Realizing who he was, one of the yogis said: ‘You have just come from God Himself. What is He doing now?’ Narada replied, ‘Why, I saw Him making camels and elephants pass and repass through the eye of a needle.’ At this the yogi said: ‘Is that anything to wonder at? Everything is possible for God.’ But the other yogi said: ‘What? Making elephants pass through the eye of a needle — is that ever possible? You have never been to the Lord’s dwelling-place.'” (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\n—–\nLatu was extremely fortunate that he got the opportunity to live with Ramakrishna and serve him for over six years. Sri Ramakrishna taught Latu various spiritual disciplines. One day while Latu was massaging Ramakrishna’s feet, the Master asked, “Do you know what your Lord Rama is doing now?” Latu was dumbfounded and kept quiet. The Master said, “Your Lord Rama is now passing an elephant through the eye of a needle.” Latu understood that Ramakrishna, out of compassion, was pouring spirituality into him. Later, Latu reminisced: “Did you know that the Master snatched me from the snares of the world? I was an orphan. He flooded me with love and affection. If he had not accepted me, I would have been like an animal, spending all my days working like a slave. My life would have been worth nothing. I am an unlettered man. He used to tell me: ‘Always keep your mind spotless. Don’t allow impure thoughts to enter it. If you find such desires tormenting you, pray to God and chant His name. He will protect you. If the mind still will not remain calm, then go to the temple of the Mother and sit before Her. Or else come here [pointing to himself].’” (Source: God Lived with Them)\n—–\nThe conversation again turned to Divine Incarnation.\nNARENDRA:\n“It is enough to have faith in God. I don’t care about what He is doing or what He hangs from. Infinite is the universe; infinite are the Incarnations.” (\nSvatasvatara Upanishad 6.23\n)\nAs Sri Ramakrishna heard the words, “Infinite is the universe; infinite are the Incarnations”, he said with folded hands, “Ah!”\nM. whispered something to Bhavanath.\nBHAVANATH:\n“M. says: ‘As long as I have not seen the elephant, how can I know whether it can pass through the eye of a needle? I do not know God; how can I understand through reason whether or not He can incarnate Himself as man?”\nMASTER:\n“Everything is possible for God. It is He who casts the spell. The magician swallows the knife and takes it out again; he swallows stones and bricks.” (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)",

    "translation": "Being of the deceitful nature of fiends and demons, they cherish vain hopes, perform vain actions, pursue vain knowledge, and are devoid of judgement.",
    "commentary": "Human nature is divided into two types (1) the Divine (Daivi Prakriti) and (2) the undivine (Asuriprakriti). The Lord is here referring to the latter men of undivine nature. Their hopes are vain, empty, their actions are vain, producing nothing good or permanent. Their knowledge is also vain, because it is confined to the senses and the perishable world. Such knowledge viewed from the spiritual plane is empty, vain and useless. They are devoid of understanding and so they have no thought of anything beyond the body. Such men are possessed of the devilish and undivine nature. The Tamasic Guna or the dark quality of Prakriti characterises the beings here spoken of as rakshasic and asuric. Rakshasas are semi-human beings, brutal and blood-thristry. The asuras are the opponents of the Devas. The Devas have sattvaguna. The asuras possess rajoguna. They have evil desires and use their powers in evil ways. Their life is useless. That is why the world useless (mogha) is repeated three times in this verse. The point is that all those people live in the empty world of Maya. So whatever they do or think or hope is empty nothing, signifying nothing.\nThe seekers have to understand the sharp distinction between the real and the unreal. Atma alone is real. Nothing else. Knowing this, they should move towards Reality, giving up all foolish and vain hopes and actions. They should cultivate good qualities like self-control, sense restraint, discrimination and humility. They should become the instruments of the Divine. They should be the servants of the Lord. Their thoughts and actions should follow the divine law.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda",

These two attributes are not to be found in any other thing or person. The Lord is the Ancient, beyond birth and death, and universal. Thus the great souls distinguish the Lord from all other material or superficial things.

They think, sing and speak of the Lord’s glory always. Such adoration comes through constant striving. The striving is not intermittent but continuous. They are steadfast in vows.\nThe Lord emphasises firmness many times. The mind is saturated with powerful past samskaras, impurities of raga and dvesha, acquired through several births. They cannot be eliminated except by firmness and steadfast striving. The seeker has to practice certain vows to purify the body and mind (fasting, silence, japa, dhyana, brahmacharya). These vows should be followed with cheerfulness, courage and determination. Otherwise, progress on the spiritual path is obstructed and the seekers are drawn away from the goal by the force of ignorance (avidya). Firm vows are strong weapons with which avidya could be defeated and overcome.\nNitya yuktah:\nThey are always attached to the Lord, with devotion. Their worship is illumined by devotion. It is noteworthy how the Lord emphasises devotion to Him at every step. It is merely intellectual understanding but deep emotional realisation which leads to the Lord.

When Lord Krishna completes the Gita Sastra, He declares that he who studies and tries to understand the spirit of the Gita is said to have worshipped the Lord through Knowledge-sacrifice (18-70).

This is experienced by all every day. The Lord is is the e eternal Father, Mother, and Grandfather. At all times whether in this life or beyond, He is with us always. When one is under the protecting power of the Divine Parents, there cannot be any fear in life or death. So the love that one has for his earthly relations should be sublimated into divine love for the Lord who confers Moksha as the highest reward of devotion.\nThe one thing to be known in this world is the Lord. All other knowledge is of no use if it does not lead to an understanding of the Lord. Knowing\nParamatma\n, man knows everything. Not knowing Him, man knows nothing even if he has read all the books in the world.",

    "translation": "O I give heat; I hold back and send forth rain. I am immortality, O Arjuna, and also death. I am being and I am non-being.",
    "commentary": "The Lord is the cause for the origin of the world and all the activities taking place in it. As an illustration, the phenomena of rain is explained here. The Sun causes heat and absorbs water and then again releases it in the form of rain. The whole of the natural phenomena as we understand is the work of the Lord Himself. If we extend the analogy, we will find that every force, small or great, is nothing but the manifestation of the Lord.\nWhen the rope is mistaken for the snake, the rope, as the foundation, has not in any way changed. So also, what appears as the universe is in reality Brahman. So everything in the world like death and immortality, like being and non-being relatively is nothing but Brahman.\nThe words “being” and “non-being” are used in the sense of the manifested and the unmanifested. The unmanifested, or “non-being,” is the cause of the manifested, or “being.” The word “non-being” is not used in the text in the sense of “non-existence.”\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda\nSwami Vivekananda Says —\nThe thinker of this philosophy has been struck by the idea that one power is behind all phenomena. In our thought of God, there is human limitation, personality: with Shakti comes the idea of One Universal Power. “I stretch the bow of Rudra when He desires to kill”, says Shakti. The Upanishads did not develop this thought; for Vedanta does not care for the God-idea. But in the Gita comes the significant saying to Arjuna, “I am the real, and I am the unreal. I bring good, and I bring evil.”\n[Source]\nSri Ramakrishna Says —\nMASTER (\nsmiling, to M\n.):\n“He went there [referring to Bodh-Gaya].”\nM. (to Narendra):\n“What are the doctrines of Buddha?”\nNARENDRA:\n“He could not express in words what he had realised by his tapasya. So people say he was an atheist.”\nMASTER (\nby signs\n):\n“Why atheist? He was not an atheist. He simply could not express his inner experiences in words.\nDo you know what ‘Buddha’ means? It is to become one with Bodha, Pure Intelligence, by meditating on That which is of the nature of Pure Intelligence; it is to become Pure Intelligence Itself.”\nNARENDRA:\n“Yes, sir. There are three classes of Buddhas: Buddha, Arhat, and Bodhisattva.”\nMASTER:\n“This too is a sport of God Himself, a new lila of God.\n“Why should Buddha be called an atheist? When one realises Svarupa, the true nature of one’s Self, one attains a state that is something between asti, is, and nasti,\nis-not\n.”\nNARENDRA (\nto M\n.):\n“It is a state in which contradictions meet. A combination of hydrogen and oxygen produces cool water; and the same hydrogen and oxygen are used in the oxy-hydrogen blowpipe.\n“In that state both activity and non-activity are possible; that is to say, one then performs unselfish action.\n“Worldly people, who are engrossed in sense-objects, say that everything exists —\nasti\n. But the mayavadis, the illusionists, say that nothing exists —\nnasti\n. The experience of a Buddha is beyond both ‘existence’ and ‘non-existence’.”\nMASTER:\n“This ‘existence’ and ‘non-existence’ are attributes of Prakriti. The Reality is beyond both.”\nThe devotees remained silent a few moments. (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\n—–\nMASTER (\nto M. and the others\n):\n“Is it an easy thing to obtain the Knowledge of Brahman? It is not possible unless the mind is annihilated. The guru said to the disciple,\n‘Give me your mind and I shall give you Knowledge.’\nIn this state one enjoys only spiritual talk and the company of devotees.\n(\nTo Ram\n) “You are a physician. You know that medicine works only when it mixes with the patient’s blood and becomes one with it. Likewise, in the state of Brahmajnana one sees God both within and without. One sees that it is God Himself who has become the body, mind, life, and soul.”\nM. (\nto himself\n):\n“Assimilation!”\nMASTER:\n“A man attains Brahmajnana as soon as his mind is annihilated. With the annihilation of the mind dies the ego, which says ‘I’, ‘I’. One also attains the Knowledge of Brahman by following the path of devotion. One also attains It by following the path of knowledge, that is to say, discrimination. The jnanis discriminate, saying, ‘Neti, neti’, that is, ‘All this is illusory, like a dream.’ They analyse the world through the process of ‘Not this, not this’; it is maya. When the world vanishes, only the jivas, that is to say, so many egos, remain.\n“Each ego may be likened to a pot. Suppose there are ten pots filled with water, and the sun is reflected in them. How many suns do you see?”\nA DEVOTEE:\n“Ten reflections. Besides, there certainly exists the real sun.”\nMASTER:\n“Suppose you break one pot. How many suns do you see now?”\nDEVOTEE:\n“Nine reflected suns. But there certainly exists the real Sun.”\nMASTER:\n“All right. Suppose you break nine pots. How many suns do you see now?”\nDEVOTEE:\n“One reflected sun. But there certainly exists the real sun.”\nMASTER (\nto Girish\n):\n“What remains when the last pot is broken?”\nGIRISH:\n“That real sun, sir.”\nMASTER:\n“No. What remains cannot be described. What\nis\nremains. How will you know there is a real sun unless there is a reflected sun? ‘I- consciousness’ is destroyed in samadhi. A man climbing down from samadhi to the lower plane cannot describe what he has seen there.” (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\nRâmlâl (nephew of Shri Ramakrishna) came from Dakshineswar. He had long lived with and served the Master and had often sent him into ecstasy by singing devotional songs. He was, therefore, dearly loved by the Order of Ramakrishna. In course of conversation he said:\n“Formerly, the Master and Hriday used to live in the large room of the Kuthi (a building in the Dakshineswar temple) and the Master’s mother used to sleep in an adjoining small room. Many nights they used to hear a man with shoes on going up and down the stairs, and opening doors and windows. It was a ghost-possibly of a European. For the Kuthi had been a European residence before the temple was built.\nThe Master used to say, ‘We cannot say that this world is entirely false. For we are actually seeing it with our eyes. Nor can we say that it is real. For just see how this garden has changed. Formerly it was a graveyard, and this Kuthi, the house of a European. But now! And some days after, this temple also will vanish, and who knows what will come next ?’\n– Swami Premananda (Source: Spiritual Talks by the First Disciples of Sri Ramakrishna)\nThe very idea ‘I am the body’ is itself a misapprehension. It is the sole cause of birth, death, decay, disease… all of it. Hence the only way to be free of these is to be free of the body-identity; that can happen only through the right knowledge. There is a verse in the Bhagavata which says, “The Lord has two forms. When we open our senses and behold the world, the Lord is before us as the all-devouring time.” We can worship Him as such. Worshipping kāla is saṃsāra. This is what everyone does, and the fruit of such worship is death. The Bhagavata continues, “The same Lord is within you as Consciousness, as Purusha. If you turn your mind inward and realise Him in your heart, the fruit is immortality—amṛtatva. The same Lord, on the one side, is death, and on the other side, immortality.”* That is why in the Gita itself, Krishna says, “amṛtaṃ caiva mṛtyuśca—I am both immortality and death” (BG9.19).

    "translation": "The knowers of the Vedas, the drinkers of Soma, purified of sins, worshipping Me by sacrifices, pray for the way to Heaven. They having attained the world of Indra, enjoy the heavenly pleasures of the Devas.",
    "commentary": "The Lord here describes the attitude of some aspirants who seek the pleasures of Heaven by performing sacrifices. They are learned men who have studied the Vedas; they are purified by sacrifices; but they are attached to sense-pleasures, and so they desire for the finer and subtler enjoyments of the Gods. Their prayer is for heavenly joys. And they get them by the merit of their Yajnas. They are evolved beings no doubt, but they are imperfect because they have not realised the Brahmananda arising from Self-realisation. Whatever world it is, however rich and exhilarating the pleasures of the Gods may be, they are subject to death and birth. They have to return.\nWhat if the shackles are made of gold? They are still bonds which limit the immeasurable joy of self-realisation. That cannot be the goal. The cycle of birth and death should be stopped by knowing the truth, which al alone brings freedom to man. To be a slave here or in Heaven cannot satisfy the true aspirant. He should aim at the highest, the Atmic state, attaining which he is forever in bliss and blessedness.\nTherefore the wise man should strive for the Eternal state of Brahman, and not the transitory enjoyments of Heaven or any other world. The Vedas deal with sacrifices and other forms of worship which lead to enjoyment, but that is not the end of the Vedas. The end is Brahma jnana, and all people should have to come up to this goal. Sacrifices purify the mind, if they are performed without any desire for the fruit thereof. But if man performs these things with attachment he cannot derive the necessary purity to remain steadfast in the contemplation of the Self.\nThe deluded soul thirsting for enjoyment prays to the Lord for Heavenly joys through the performance of sacrifices. How unwise it would be to stand before the Supreme Lord and pray for such meager pleasures of Heaven? Is not the Lord, the very source of all bliss and blessedness? Why not pray for union with Him? Why not pray for the bliss of liberation?\nIf liberation is the goal of mankind, the question may arise why the Vedas have so elaborately described the Yajnas yielding various worldly and other-worldly benefits? What is its purpose? The answer is that man has to be weaned away from lower sinful pleasures by presenting before him the purer and more lasting joys of Heaven. The Vedas have done this. Man is partially rescued from the clutches of earthly things and sinful activities. Then after many many births, the same man would find out for himself that he has no rest wherever he might go, and that he has to fall back to the earth again and again. When he realises the uselessness of these enjoyments, then he would naturally seek for a joy that would not come to an end, and that joy cannot be had anywhere else except in the Self Atma.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda",

    "translation": "They having enjoyed the vast Heaven-world, the merit being exhausted, enter the world of mortals; thus, those who desire enjoyments, abiding by the law of the Vedas have to go and return endlessly.",
    "commentary": "The Lord explains very clearly how the desire-prompted men do not find rest either here or in Heaven. They have to go through the painful process of birth and death. Dying here, they go to Heaven and from there, after exhausting the fruits of merit (punya) they fall back again to the earth, and take birth as mortals. Such is the fate of men yielding to desire, however rich and vast it might be. From this one understands that human life is the only opportunity for Self-realisation. All the other worlds are worlds of enjoyment good or bad. This world is the world of action and jnana. Let us hear the exhortation of Swami Vivekananda – “Man therefore according to Vedanta philosophy is the greatest being that is in the universe, and the world of work is the best place in it, because only herein is the greatest and best chance for him to become perfect. Angels or  Gods whatever you may call them, have all to become men, if they want to be perfect. This is the greatest centre, the wonderful poise, and the wonderful opportunity – this human life.”\nThe Vedas follow a rational order with reference to human life and man’s progress and perfection. The first part is Karma Kanda, the second Upasana Kanda, and the third Janana Kanda. We see how man develops gradually and reaches perfection. The Karma Kanda deals with the desire-fulfilling actions of man. When man discovers that these desires and their fulfillment do not give him rest or peace, he discards them and rises a step higher, and finally, remains at perfection in the realisation of God. He comes to the Jnana Kanda.\nKarma is no doubt good in itself, but it should be free from desire and attachment. Otherwise, man has to undergo the painful process of being born again and again either here or in the other worlds. In the Samkhya-yoga and in many other places, the Lord emphasises the need for the elimination of desire as the only way to perfection. Desire implies imperfection. The perfect man cannot have any desires.\nThe desireless state of perfection should be the goal of all spiritual aspirants.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda",

So there is a difference in the fruits of merit. The various Devas may confer different rewards of health and wealth, children and prosperity in worldly life, but the worship of the Supreme confers the highest reward of Moksha (liberation). Whatever may be the object of worship, faith is essential. With such faith, if the Lord is worshipped the devotee obtains liberation.\nBhagavad Gita 9.23 to 9.25 by Swami Chetanananda\nSwami Vivekananda Says —\nLater on we read what Krishna says, “Even those who worship other deities are really worshipping me.” It is God incarnate whom man is worshipping. Would God be angry if you called Him by the wrong name? He would be no God at all! Can’t you understand that whatever a man has in his own heart is God — even if he worships a stone? What of that!\n[Source]\nSri Ramakrishna Says —\nMASTER (\nto Balaram’s father and the others\n):\n“The\nBhaktamala\nis one of the Vaishnava books. It is a fine book. It describes the lives of the various Vaishnava devotees. But it is one-sided. At one place the author found peace of mind only after compelling Bhagavati, the Divine Mother, to take Her initiation according to the Vaishnava discipline.\n“Once I spoke highly of Vaishnavcharan to Mathur and persuaded him to invite Vaishnavcharan to his house. Mathur welcomed him with great courtesy. He fed his guest from silver plates. Then do you know what happened? Vaishnav said in front of Mathur, ‘You will achieve nothing whatsoever in spiritual life unless you accept Krishna as your Ideal.’ Mathur was a follower of the Sakta cult and a worshipper of the Divine Mother. At once his face became crimson. I nudged Vaishnavcharan.\n“I understand that the\nBhagavata\nalso contains some statements like that. I hear that it is said there that trying to cross the ocean of the world without accepting Krishna as the Ideal Deity is like trying to cross a great sea by holding to the tail of a dog. Each sect magnifies its own view.\n“The Saktas, too, try to belittle the Vaishnavas. The Vaishnavas say that Krishna alone is the Helmsman to take one across the ocean of the world. The Saktas retort: ‘Oh, yes! We agree to that. Our Divine Mother is the Empress of the Universe. Why should She bother about a ferry-boat? Therefore She has engaged that fellow Krishna for the purpose.’ (\nAll laugh\n.)\n“Besides, how vain people are about their own sects! There are weavers in the villages near Kamarpukur. Many of them are Vaishnavas and like to talk big. They say: ‘Which Vishnu does he worship? The Preserver? Oh, we wouldn’t touch him!’ Or: ‘Which Siva are you talking about? We accept the Atmarama Siva.’ Or again, ‘Please explain to us which Hari you worship.’ They spin their yarn and indulge in talk like that.\n“Rati’s mother, Rani Katyayani’s favourite confidante, is a follower of Vaishnavcharan. She is a bigoted Vaishnava. She used to visit me very frequently, and none could outdo her in devotion. One day she noticed me eating the prasad from the Kali temple. Since then I haven’t seen even her shadow.\n25.22 Master’s harmony of religions\n“\nHe is indeed a real man who has harmonized everything. Most people are one-sided. But I find that all opinions point to the One. All views — the Sakta, the Vaishnava, the Vedanta — have that One for their centre. He who is formless is, again, endowed with form. It is He who appears in different forms. The attributeless Brahman is my Father. God with attributes is my Mother. Whom shall I blame? Whom shall I praise?\nThe two pans of the scales are equally heavy.’\n“He who is described in the Vedas is also described in the Tantras and the Puranas. All of them speak about the one Satchidananda. The Nitya and the Lila are the two aspects of the one Reality. It is described in the Vedas as ‘Om Satchidananda Brahman’, in the Tantras as ‘Om Satchidananda Siva’, the ever-pure Siva, and in the Puranas as ‘Om Satchidananda Krishna’. All the scriptures, the Vedas, the Puranas, and the Tantras, speak only of one Satchidananda. It is stated in the Vaishnava scriptures that it is Krishna Himself who has become Kali.”\n(Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\nRelated Articles:\nO Arjuna!

No one gets anything other than what he thinks intensely.\nNaturally, the wise man chooses the imperishable goal of Paramatma who liberates him from all bondage and gives him complete freedom and perfection. Of what use is to worship this or that Deva or Pitri or Bhuta, who can only give some perishable things and once again throws man down into Samsara? Let the aspirant think clearly of the goal he has to reach. Let him not be content with lesser things which have brought misery and death endlessly. Let him aspire for the highest perfection by worshipping the Supreme Lord. Let the ‘Devavrata’ (worshipper of the Devas) transform himself into ‘Atmavrata’ (worshipper of Atma). Then he reaches the blissful state of Paramatma, and all his wishes and desires shall find fulfillment in that Realisation.",

    "translation": "Whosoever offers Me, with devotion, a leaf, a flower, a fruit, or water— that I accept, the pious offering of the pure in heart.",
    "commentary": "This verse is very important for all aspirants. In the previous\nverse\n, it was stated that the worshipper invariably goes to the object of his worship. If the Lord is the objective, the worshipper reaches Him. The same discipline and devotion needed for the worship of other Devas is enough to please the Lord. This being so, why should he have a lesser and lower objective than the Lord Himself? The Lord explains the very easy nature of His worship. No elaborate sacrifices are needed, no large charities are needed, no great offerings are needed. A leaf, a flower or a fruit or even water, is enough to please the Lord, and when the Lord is pleased, all the Devas, Pitris and Bhutas are pleased. All the rewards which the worshippers hope to derive from the worship of the Devas are derived by the worship of Paramatma and His worship is absolutely within the reach of every human being. Two conditions are stated here:\nThe giver should be pure-minded.\nThe offering should be made with devotion.\nKingdom, treasures and empires do not satisfy the Lord when there is no purity and devotion; where these are, even a leaf or a fruit is enough to draw the grace of God. He is pleased and satisfied with such offerings when the worshipper is a true Bhakta. Lord Krishna did not accept the hospitality of the proud Duryodhana, but dined with the humble Vidura. corn offered by Kuchela was accepted by the Lord with great pleasure, and the reward which he received is well known to all.\nWhat is required is (1) purity of heart, and (2) true devotion. Even the humblest and the most ignorant man receives God’s grace by purity and devotion. The richest and the most powerful shall have to go without it, if they are arrogant and self-indulgent. That is why one comes across some learned scholars plunged in the mire of samsara in spite of their Sastric learning. That is why kings and emperors have sought refuge at the feet of sages in their troubles and sorrows. The pure man alone is happy. The devotee alone is fearless.\nThe Lord is the King of Kings. He is the maker and unmaker of all the worlds. Love and devotion are the only things by which the Lord is pleased. If he is pleased, all the world and all the beings are pleased.\nWe recall to mind the wonderful episode in the Mahabharata when the Pandavas were in exile, sage Durvasa came with all his disciples to the hermitage of Pandavas and wanted to be fed; Draupadi had nothing in the pot except a few bits of cooked food. She thought of the Lord and he came and tasted the few bits of cooked food, and lo, the miracle! and his disciples felt surfeited and could take no more food, even when they were requested by Pandavas to accept their hospitality. Please the Lord, and all other beings shall be pleased.\nThose who worship Him with single-minded devotion are God’s own children. God’s mercy is on them at all times, and in all places. They receive Atmajnana. The Upanishads declare the same truth.\nDraupadi and Vidura offered a leaf; Gajendra offered a flower; Sabari offered a fruit; Ranti Deva offered water. With their purity and devotion these great devotees attained the Lord by simple offerings.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda\nSwami Vivekananda Says —\nIf you are strong, take up the Vedanta philosophy and be independent. If you cannot do that, worship God; if not, worship some image. If you lack strength even to do that, do some good works without the idea of gain. Offer everything you have unto the service of the Lord. Fight on! “Leaves and water and one flower — whosoever lays anything on my altar, I receive it with equal delights.”\n[Source]\nSo she (*) bathed and dressed the image, burned incense before it, and for offering? — Oh, she was so poor! — but with tears in her eyes she remembered her husband reading from the books: “I accept with gladness even leaves and flowers, fruits and water, whatever is offered with love”, and she offered: “Thou for whom the world of flowers bloom, accept my few common flowers. Thou who feedest the universe, accept my poor offerings of fruits. I am weak, I am ignorant. I do not know how to approach Thee, how to worship Thee, my God, my Cowherd, my child; let my worship be pure, my love for Thee selfless; and if there is any virtue in worship, let it be Thine, grant me only love, love that never asks for anything — ‘never seeks for anything but love’.”\n[Source]\n… Continue your sadhana [spiritual practices]. It will surely bear results. The saint Tulasidas said, “Whatever way you sow the seed in the soil, pointing either up or down, its sprout will rise upward.” Similarly, if you practise your sadhana wholeheartedly, it will produce good results, even though your means may not be perfect. If you have real devotion in your heart, the Lord will see it; he does not count human imperfections. The Lord knows our inmost thoughts. There is a saying: “The prayer of an unlettered person may be grammatically wrong and the prayer of a learned man may be correct, but both prayers will render the same virtue; because God accepts only the inmost feelings.” …\n— Swami Turiyananda (Spiritual Treasures: Letters of Swami Turiyananda)\nSurendra was rich, aristocratic, and extremely sensitive. M. described how one day in 1881 the Master crushed Surendra’s ego at his own home:\nSurendra approached the Master with a garland and wanted to put it around his neck. But the Master took it in his hand and threw it aside. Surendra’s pride was wounded and his eyes filled with tears. He went to the west porch and sat with Ram, Manomohan, and the others. In a voice choked with sadness he said: “I am really angry. How can a poor brahmin know the value of a thing like that? I spent a lot of money for that garland, and he refused to accept it. I was unable to control my anger and said that the other garlands were to be given away to the devotees. Now I realize it was all my fault. God cannot be bought with money; he cannot be possessed by a vain person. I have really been vain. Why should he accept my worship? I don’t feel like living anymore.” Tears streamed down his cheeks and over his chest.\nIn the meantime Trailokya was singing inside the room. The Master began to dance in an ecstasy of joy. He put around his neck the garland that he had thrown aside; holding it with one hand, he swung it with the other as he danced and sang. Now Surendra’s joy was unbounded. The Master had accepted his offering. Surendra said to himself, “God crushes one’s pride, no doubt, but he is also the cherished treasure of the humble and lowly.”\nWhen the kirtan was over, everyone sat around the Master and became engaged in pleasant conversation. Sri Ramakrishna said to Surendra, “Won’t you give me something to eat?” Then he went into the inner apartments, where the ladies saluted him. After the meal Sri Ramakrishna left for Dakshineswar. (Source: God Lived with Them)\nHere is the narration of the profound story of Yogi Vemana, which illustrates his lifelong philosophy that\npurity of heart outweighs social status.\nYogi Vemana – The Wandering Mystic\nYogi Vemana, the great Telugu philosopher and poet, was a\nParivrajaka\n—a wandering ascetic. He traveled from village to village, naked or clad only in a loincloth, challenging the rigid caste systems, empty rituals, and the hypocrisy of the wealthy.\nOne scorching afternoon, Vemana arrived in a small, bustling village. As news of the great saint’s arrival spread, the villagers gathered. Among them were the wealthy landlords, learned scholars, and priests, all eager to earn merit (\nPunya\n) by feeding the holy man.\nThe Feast of Pride\nA wealthy merchant, dressed in fine silks, pushed his way to the front. He held a silver plate filled with exotic delicacies—sweet rice, ghee-laden curries, and fruits. He bowed, not out of humility, but to show the crowd his capacity to offer such a feast.\n“Swami,” the merchant said, his chest puffed with pride. “Please accept this bhiksha (alms). It is the finest food in the village, prepared by the highest caste cooks in a ritualistically pure kitchen.”\nVemana looked at the silver plate, then at the merchant. With a dismissive wave of his hand, he refused.\n“Take it away,” Vemana said abruptly. “This food smells of filth.”\nThe crowd gasped. The merchant was insulted. “Filth? Swami, this is pure vegetarian food served on silver! How can it be filthy?”\nVemana remained silent, closing his eyes, refusing to engage with the man’s ego. Other wealthy villagers tried to offer him food, but he rejected them all, sensing the arrogance and desire for social validation behind their charity.\nThe Offering of Love\nStanding at the very edge of the crowd was an elderly beggar woman. She belonged to the so-called “untouchable” caste. She was dressed in rags, holding an old, chipped clay pot. Inside, she had a small amount of\nAmbali\n(a simple, watery ragi gruel) that she had begged for herself that morning.\nShe watched the rejection of the rich with fear. She thought,\n“If the Swami rejects the feasts of kings, surely he will spit on my poor gruel.”\nHowever, seeing Vemana sitting under the hot sun, her heart ached with a motherly compassion. She forgot her caste and her poverty; she only saw a hungry child of God.\nVemana opened his eyes and looked straight at her. His face broke into a gentle smile. He extended his cupped hands toward her.\n“Mother,”\nhe called out gently.\n“I am very hungry. will you not feed me?”\nThe crowd was horrified. The woman trembled. “Swami, I… I am of low birth. This is just leftover gruel in a dirty pot.”\n“Give it to me,” Vemana insisted.\nWith shaking hands, she poured the gruel into his hands. Vemana drank it with immense relish, licking his fingers as if he had just tasted the nectar of the heavens.\nThe Lesson\nThe rich merchant, unable to contain his anger, shouted, “Swami! You rejected my pure food on a silver plate, calling it filth, yet you eat the leftovers of an untouchable beggar from a clay pot? What kind of madness is this?”\nVemana stood up, his eyes blazing with the wisdom of a\nYogi\n.\n“Your food was cooked in a ‘pure’ kitchen, but it was served with a heart full of arrogance and pride. You wanted to feed your ego, not my hunger. Therefore, it was impure.”\nHe pointed to the old woman.\n“She has nothing. She gave me the food that was meant for her own survival. She gave it not for fame, but because her heart cried for my hunger. Her pot may be made of clay, but her heart is made of gold.\nFood served with affection is nectar; food served with pride is poison.\n“\nThe Essence\nThe villagers stood in silence, humbled. Vemana had once again taught them that in the eyes of the Divine, the vessel does not matter—only the contents of the heart do.\nThis incident is often summarized by the essence of Vemana’s poetry (\nVemana Padyalu\n):\n“Metuku vendi paatra mida unna phalamemi?\nManasu niluva leni manishi kante…\nBhakthi leni puuja patri chetu…”\n(Meaning: What is the use of a grain of rice on a silver plate if the mind is not steady? Worship without devotion is a waste.)",

Where is the Moksha? Here is the meaning of it. Freedom from bondage is Moksha. What is this bondage: The bondage of karma done by men with a sense of personal doership and desire for its fruits. To give up the fruits of karma to God is Moksha. It is Sanyasa. From the point of view of self-realisation, both good and evil are in the realm of the unreal. But the seeker has to release himself from evil first and then give up good also. Then he reaches the Nirvikalpa state.

    "translation": "I am the same toward all beings; to Me there is none hateful or dear. But those who worship Me with devotion— they are in Me, and I too am in them.",
    "commentary": "This declaration of the Lord that He is the same to all beings should be carefully noted by all aspirants. The Lord does not hate any being, nor is any being dear to Him. His grace is overflowing for all people. To make Him responsible for the good and evil things that come to man in the course of this life is utter nonsense. And yet even learned people are so deluded that they complain against God in moments of crisis and calamity. The Lord has nothing to do with the ups and downs, losses and gains, pleasures and pains of all beings. Each one reaps the fruits of his own thoughts and actions. One reaps what he sows. The law is universal and eternal. Let the seeker realise the full responsibility for the good and bad that comes to him. Let him never shift the blame to anyone else.\nThough the Lord is the same to all beings, they are not all the same to Him. Hatred and malice lead people into evil and this evil causes sorrow and misery. Some enlightened souls avoid such thoughts and feelings and cultivate an attitude of love and friendliness, so they enjoy life better. They come nearer to God and experience bliss and blessedness.\nLet no one imagine that God’s grace has not come to him. God’s grace, like the wind, is blowing everywhere. Intrepid sailors spread the sails and make rapid progress on the ocean of spirituality, whereas the lazy remain where they are.\nThe devotee is assured that the Lord is in them and they are in Him. This is due to the devotion of the aspirant. The Lord is like the fire in the cold season. The nearer one moves towards it, the warmer he feels. The farther away he is, the colder he feels. This is the natural law. The Lord states very clearly that he lives in the hearts of his devotees who worship him with love and devotion. Such a man is the very temple of God. They are God Himself because the Lord is directly manifest in them.\nSingle-minded devotion leads man to the Supreme Lord, who is present in all beings and who manifests Himself in the heart of the true devotee.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda\nOne day the Mother invited Amzad for lunch and served him on the porch of her house. Owing to caste prejudices, Nalini, the Mother’s niece, threw the food at Amzad’s leaf plate from a distance. Holy Mother noticed this and said: “How can one enjoy food when it is served with such scorn? Let me wait on him properly.” After Amzad had finished his meal, Holy Mother cleaned the place where he had sat with her own hands. Nalini shrieked: “Aunt, you have lost your caste!”\n“Keep quiet,” the Mother scolded her. Then she added: “As Sharat is my son, exactly so is Amzad.” Sharat was a direct disciple of Ramakrishna, the secretary of the Ramakrishna Mission, and a monk endowed with saintly virtues; Amzad was a Muslim and a convicted robber. Thus Holy Mother demonstrated that she is the Mother of the good and the bad. She also showed that kind treatment can enkindle faith in the heart of a weak, lowly man and prove to him that he is a son of the Divine Mother. Her example brought to life the words of Krishna: “I am the same towards all beings; to Me there is none hateful or dear. But those who worship Me with devotion—they are in Me, and I too am in them.” (Source: Sri Sarada Devi and Her Divine Play)\nThe sages look with equal eye on a Brahmana endowed with knowledge and humility, on a cow, on an elephant, on a dog and on the outcaste who feeds on dog’s flesh. (\nBG 5.18\n)\nRamcharitmanas (Uttar Kand)\n“Jati-pati-puchha nahi koi, hari ko bhaje so hari ko hoi.”\n“Caste or lineage does not matter; whoever worships Hari becomes His own.”",

    "commentary": "Though the most wicked of men, if he takes refuge in the Lord with faith and devotion, striving to give up his wickedness, he should be regarded as a righteous and holy person. The Lord uses the superlative term (\nsudurucharah\n) to indicate the worst forms of sin and evil. Even such a person should be known as holy by virtue of his absolute self-surrender to the Lord. The reason is that he has come to the right decision that\nParamatma\nis the only Reality and he has obtained a glimpse of this ultimate truth. He has realised the illusory nature of the world, and so he has taken final refuge in the only Reality-Paramatma. His decision is right and his salvation is then assured by the Lord.\nHe is ceaselessly contemplating the Lord and does not touch anything other than Atma. The evil pertaining to such a person is burnt up in the flame of knowledge. A heap of straw lying for several years be reduced to ashes by fire. So the accumulated evil of past births is destroyed by the fire of knowledge. The darkness existing in a remote mountain-cave for thousands of years is destroyed immediately when a match is lighted. So the evil in man however ancient it might be is destroyed by the flash of knowledge. The\nasadhu\nbecomes a\nsadhu\n, the demon becomes a God. What brings about this wonderful transformation? Pure devotion and the right knowledge.\nTherefore, let no sinner be disheartened that the weight of sin is too much for him to bear. Let him decide right. Let him take refuge in the Lord, with faith and devotion. He is freed from all sin. He is then a righteous man (sadhu). Instead of condemning people as sinners, it is necessary to rouse the divinity in them and this is the greatest act of goodness which the realised man can do for humanity.\nThe point to remember is that nothing good can come out of dull contemplation of one’s own weaknesses, past and present. He should act positively and try to understand d what is true and what is false. He should surrender himself to God, and that very moment he transcends all evil.\nWhatever evil clings to man in the state of ignorance, that is cleared off by right decision, and determination.\nThe path of God is the right path. The path of the world (\ndrisya\n) is the wrong path.\nThe word ‘\nsadhu\n‘ refers to the righteous man who is leading a truly spiritual life.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda",

    "commentary": "The effect of the right decision is declared here. The wicked man quickly becomes a righteous man (‘Dharmatma’), and attains eternal peace.\nThis point should be carefully understood because all progress in spiritual life depends on correct and firm decision.\nOne may read all the sastras in the world and yet cling desperately to the ephemeral things of the world. Such a man has not come to the right decision in spite of his learning and erudition. The decision that Paramatma alone is Real, and that He alone is the ultimate refuge should be reached.\nBut doubt and darkness cover up the mind, and the truth, though repeatedly heard, does not sink into the mind and illumine the heart.\nBut, when the correct decision is reached, accepted, and confirmed by one’s own heart, he immediately becomes a righteous man, whatever his former sins might be. Not only does he become righteous, but he enjoys supreme eternal peace. The Upanishads declare “Unto them comes peace and to none else.”\nThe second line of the verse is the Lord’s proclamation to the world. “My devotee never perishes.” This is a ‘\nmahamantra\n‘ for all mankind. Whenever one feels dispirited, dull and desperate, let this line be repeated, shouted at the highest pitch, so that the clouds of doubt and despair might to cleared, and the Lord becomes manifest in his own heart. How can a man suffer from thirst when the holy Ganga is flowing by? How can a man become desperate when the loving Lord is standing by? No. Let there be no doubt about it. The Lord throws a challenge to all doubters – “Have faith in Me, thou shall not be destroyed.” Let the feeble and infirm doubters feel the warmth of this declaration. The compassionate Lord wants Arjuna to proclaim to all mankind that His devotees shall never suffer destruction. Remembering this promise, may all aspirants move forward on the glorious path of Self-realiation.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda",

Even they transcend samsara by faith and devotion to the Lord.\nMoreover women and people belonging to all castes attain the Supreme goal by taking refuge in the Lord.\nVerily no one is debarred from the highest realisation, provided he has decided aright and knows the Lord to be the One Reality. How hopeful and inspiring! No one need feel disheartened on account of the low birth, if he has developed true devotion to the Lord. Caste and creed are of no concern at all for anyone to attain Brahmajnana. This open secret is free for all. Women also are qualified for Brahma Vidya. The universality of the Gita is thus proclaimed to the whole world. The all-inclusive and all-embracing character of the Gita distinguishes it from other sectarian scriptures which deny the right of liberation to certain section of people on account of race, or creed or religion.\nMerit is the only consideration. All other artificial barriers between man and man are shattered once and for all by the teaching of the Gita.\nPurity of mind is the real test of jnana. When the mirror is pure, one can see the reflection clearly. The mirror makes no distinction between the rich and poor, or high and low. Such is Brahmajnana, the birth-right of every being in the universe.\nAmong women Sabari and the milk-maids of Brindavan, and a host of women-saints have attained the Supreme. Among Vysyas Samadhi and others may be mentioned. The story of Samadhi is found in Markandeya Purana.\nBhagavad Gita 9.32 to 9.34 by Swami Chetanananda\nSwami Vivekananda Says —\n“Women, or vaishyas, or even shudras, all reach the highest goal.” Breaking the bondages of all, the chains of all, declaring liberty to all to reach the highest goal, come the words of the Gita, rolls like thunder the mighty voice of Krishna.\n[Source]\nBut one defect which lay in the Advaita was its being worked out so long on the spiritual plane only, and nowhere else; now the time has come when you have to make it practical. It shall no more be a rahasya, a secret, it shall no more live with monks in cave and forests, and in the Himalayas; it must come down to the daily, everyday life of the people; it shall be worked out in the palace of the king, in the cave of the recluse; it shall be worked out in the cottage of the poor, by the beggar in the street, everywhere; anywhere it can be worked out. Therefore do not fear whether you are a woman or a shudra, for this religion is so great, says Lord Krishna, that even a little of it brings a great amount of good.\n[Source]",

    "commentary": "If people of sinful birth, as well as women and sudras are competent to attain Brahmajnana, how much easier it should be for the holy Brahmins and royal saints? The attributes ‘punyah’ and ‘bhaktah’ are used to emphasise the need for the possession of these qualities which alone entitle a man to reach the highest state. Mere birth cannot take any man anywhere. It is not a passport to God-realisation. Purity and devotion are absolutely essential.",

    "translation": "Fix your mind on Me, be devoted to Me, sacrifice to Me, bow down to Me. Having thus disciplined yourself, and regarding Me as the Supreme Goal, you will come to Me.",
    "commentary": "The way to reach Paramatma is clearly stated here. The seeker should converge all his activities towards that one Supreme Goal. He should think of the Lord, be devoted to Him, offer sacrifice to Him, and worship Him with all faith and humility. In word, thought and deed, he should worship the Lord. Generally, the mind wanders in the realm of the sensuous. It should be withdrawn from the world and centred in Atma. This is possible by contemplating the glorious attributes of the Self. Such contemplation develops love and adoration for the Lord. Thus thinking constantly of the blissful and ever-glorious Self, man unites himself with the Supreme. He worships Him with all devotion and humility.\nThe mind becomes that which it constantly contemplates. This is the law. Having for long contemplated worldly objects, the mind has become the world; if the mind is trained to contemplate Paramatma, it becomes that according to the same law; that is, the union of the individual self with the universal Self. This state is realised by constant contemplation and meditation on the Self, the Lord.\nLet the seekers put themselves these questions – On what is their mind resting? Is it on the world or on Paramatma? To what are they devoted? It is to the world or to the Lord? What do they worship? Is it the world of name and form or Paramatma? Where do they live and have their being? It is in the world of the senses or the seat of Atma? The Lord points the way, the only way to peace and bliss.",
