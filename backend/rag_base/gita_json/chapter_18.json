    "translation": "Arjuna said: O mighty-armed! I desire to know what sannyasa is and what tyaga is, in essence. Tell me of them separately, O controller of the senses, the slayer of Kesi, Krishna!",
    "commentary": "In different contexts in the Gita, the Lord has used the word Sannyasa and Tyaga several times (\n3-30\n;\n4-20\n;\n4-41\n;\n9-28\n;\n12-6\n;\n12-11\n;\n12-12\n;\n12-16\n;\n14-25\n). But the two terms have not been explained distinctly. Hence Arjuna’s question.\nIn the Upanishads, the two concepts of Tyaga and Sannyasa are mentioned as means to liberation.\nTyagenaike amrtattvamanusuh\nSamnyasayogad yatayas Suddhasattvah\nArjuna addresses the Lord thrice in different ways, revealing his high adoration for the Divine Teacher from whom he is learning the ultimate Truth. Such reverence for the teacher of Brahmavidya is essential for attaining spiritual illumination. The respectful questioning of Arjuna is what is known as pariprasna ‘; The proper way to approach the Guru, and place one’s doubts before him should be known by the disciple. Being pleased with such faithful devotion and reverence, the teacher showers his grace on the disciple and unravels the mystery of Divine Realisation.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda",

    "translation": "Some philosophers declare that action should be abandoned as an evil, and others (declare) that acts of\nyajna\n, and\nTapas\nshould not be abandoned.",
    "commentary": "The\nsamkhya\nphilosophers declare that all work (Karma) should be abandoned as an evil. They say that work implies the existence of the body, senses, and the mind (Upadhi) as the instruments of action. Atma is the eternal witness, and hence the upadhi is to be discarded as non-existent, and when there is no upadhi, no action can take place at all.\nOthers argue differently. They say that there is no other way except Karma to purify the mind. Even bare existence is impossible without Karma. So, they declare that righteous work, purifying acts like sacrifice, austerity and charity should be performed. They ought not to be abandoned. Thus there is a difference of view about the performance and non-performance of Karma. Having stated the difference, the Lord proceeds to give his decisive opinion on this question.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda\nMASTER (\nto Manilal and the others\n):\n“It is wise to salute a person mentally. What need is there of touching his feet? Mental salutation doesn’t embarrass anybody.\n“The attitude that my religion alone is right and all other religions are false is not good. I see that God Himself has become all these: men, images, and salagram. I see one alone in all these; I do not see two. I see only one.\n“Many people think that their opinion alone is right and others’ opinions are wrong; that they alone have won and others have lost. But a person who has gone forward may be detained by some slight obstacle, and someone who has been lagging behind may then steal a march on him. In the game of golakdham one may advance a great deal, but still somehow one’s piece may fail to reach the goal.\n“Triumph or defeat is in the hands of God. We cannot understand His ways. You must have noticed that the green coconut remains high in the tree and is exposed to the sun, but still its milk is cool. On the other hand the paniphal (A kind of aquatic fruit.) remains in the water, but when eaten it heats the body.\n“Look at the body of man. The head is the root, and it is at the top.”\nMANILAL: “What then is our duty?”\nMASTER: “To remain somehow united with God. There are two ways: karmayoga and manoyoga. Householders practise yoga through karma, the performance of duty. There are four stages of life: brahmacharya, garhasthya, vanaprastha, and sannyas. Sannyasis must renounce those karmas which are performed with special ends in view; but they should perform the daily obligatory karmas, giving up all desire for results. Sannyasis are united with God by such karmas as the acceptance of the staff, the receiving of alms, going on pilgrimage, and the performance of worship and japa.\n“It doesn’t matter what kind of action you are engaged in. You can be united with God through any action provided that, performing it, you give up all desire for its result.\n“There is the other path: manoyoga. A yogi practising this discipline doesn’t show any outward sign. He is inwardly united with God. Take Jadabharata and Sukadeva, for instance. There are many other yogis of this class, but these two are well known. They shave neither hair nor beard.\n“All actions drop away when a man reaches the stage of the paramahamsa. He always remembers the ideal and meditates on it. He is always united with God in his mind. If he ever performs an action it is to teach men.\n“A man may be united with God either through action or through inwardness of thought, but he can know everything through bhakti. Through bhakti one spontaneously experiences kumbhaka. The nerve currents and breathing calm down when the mind is concentrated. Again, the mind is concentrated when the nerve currents and breathing calm down. Then the buddhi, the discriminating power, becomes steady. The man who achieves this state is not himself aware of it.

The great Master does not leave the disciple in doubt about any spiritual problem. “This is my decision”, says Krishna. Who can have any doubt about the Lord’s decisive declaration? Others, who are subject to Maya, may err in their views and opinions, however learned they might be. But how can the Lord, who is the Ruler of Maya, who knows all about man, his nature, and his goal, state anything mistaken or erroneous? When He declares, “Now listen to my decision” – it is final, beyond all doubt. Let everybody understand that Lord as much as he can, let him follow His prescribed conduct as best as he can and transcend the evils of samsara. May the Lord be the guiding light in this darkness of ignorance. May His word be the law of conduct for all seekers.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda",

    "translation": "Acts of sacrifice, charity, and austerity should not be abandoned; they should be performed indeed; sacrifice, charity, and austerity are purifiers for the thoughtful (who do not desire for fruits).",
    "commentary": "The Lord gives His decision on the problem (1)\nNa tyajyam:\nActs of yajna, tapas and dana, should not be abandoned. (2)\nKaryam eva tat:\nthey should be performed. ‘\ntyajyam’\n(should not be abandoned) implies `\nkaryam eva’\n(should be performed). But the Lord emphasises His conclusion by putting it both in the negative and positive forms. We can understand how necessary these righteous acts are for the seekers of liberation. Sometimes we come across some philosophers and religious men who deny these acts on the ground that even good acts are a bondage and lead to further births. Their position is directly opposed to the Lord’s will. Righteous work of every kind is encouraged very frequently in the Gita. In this verse, the Lord warns not to abandon good acts like sacrifice, austerity and charity. He commands that they should be performed. Why should there be any doubt and why should man go down into lower planes by ignoring the Lord’s command? Performed without longing for the fruits, these good works purify the mind and lead to Atmajnana. There is no other way.",

    "commentary": "The Lord here explains how acts of yajna, dana and tapas should be performed. The principle is that the performer should give up the idea of doership and abandon any desire to enjoy the fruits of work.\nThese two evils (1) the feeling ‘I am the doer’, and (2) ‘I will get this reward for my doing this work’ – bind man to the wheel of birth and death.\nThey cause bondage. Therefore, the true seekers should learn to conduct these sacrifices, charities and austerities with a pure heart, giving up everything to the Lord. They attain liberation (Moksha). The Lord declares that this His decision is the ‘best’. Thus inspired by the Lord, let mankind act to His command and attain the Highest.\nSri Ramakrishna Says —\nSri Ramakrishna:\nOf little use are worship, oblations, or sacrifice.\nIf a man comes to love God, he need not trouble himself much about these activities. One needs a fan only as long as there is no breeze. The fan may be laid aside if the southern breeze blows. Then what need is there of a fan?\n(\nTo Vidyasagar\n) “The activities that you are engaged in are good. It is very good if you can perform them in a selfless spirit, renouncing egotism, giving up the idea that you are the doer. Through such action one develops love and devotion to God, and ultimately realises Him.\n“The more you come to love God, the less you will be inclined to perform action. When the daughter-in-law is with child, her mother-in-law gives her less work to do. As time goes by she is given less and less work. When the time of delivery nears, she is not allowed to do any work at all, lest it should hurt the child or cause difficulty at the time of birth.\n“By these philanthropic activities you are really doing good to yourself. If you can do them disinterestedly, your mind will become pure and you will develop love of God. As soon as you have that love you will realise Him. (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\nRelated Articles:\nBut he who rejoices, who is contented, who finds happiness in Atma only, has no work to perform. (\nBG 3.17\n)\nFor him, there is in this world no interest whatsoever by work done or not done. He does not depend upon any being for any object. (\nBG 3.18\n)\nO Arjuna! Steadfast in Yoga, giving up all attachment, unmindful of success or failure, do your work. Such equanimity of mind is called Yoga. (\nBG 2.48\n)\nIn this, no effort is ever lost and no harm is ever done. Even very little of this dharma saves a man from the Great Fear. (\nBG 2.40\n)",

To renounce them by delusion is wrong. When the mind of the Jiva is overcast by the clouds of ignorance such thoughts like abandoning Sastraic injunctions come to him. The Lord has already declared that the Sastras are, the authority about what ought to be done and what ought not to be done (17-28). Whatever May be the cause, ignorance, negligence, or laziness abandoning the obligatory acts of the Sastras is Tamasic Tyaga.\nIt is to be noted that formerly when the Lord has explained the threefold Yajna, Dana etc. he followed the order-Sattva, Rajas and Tamas. But here the order is reversed, and Tamasic Tyaga is first mentioned. The idea evidently is that the Lord wants first to condemn Tamasic and Rajasic Tyaga, before he comes to the sattvic type as the most worthy to be followed.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda",

    "translation": "He who abandons obligatory duties from fear of bodily discomfort, as painful (to the body), thus does Tamasic renunciation and obtains not the fruit of renunciation.",
    "commentary": "If the Tamasic Tyagi abandons action by ignorance, the Rajasic tyagi does so from fear of bodily discomfort. He is lazy and the dullness of the body overpowers him, preventing him from doing the practices. It is true that action which is ultimately beneficial is at first difficult to follow. So, the man of weak will-power neglects it from sheer fear of bodily pain. He renounces them as useless or beyond his power to practice. To get up at the auspicious time of Brahmamuhurta (4 A.M.), taking a good bath in cold water in the river or from a well, practising the vow of celibacy, and such other methods may appear difficult in the beginning, but in the long run, they yield the highest reward of joy and happiness, health and strength. The Rajasic Tyagi is foregoing a great good for a slight cause. Such is the power of the flesh over the spirit. We find that every great man in any field has mastered the body and made it a simple instrument for useful work. To abandon obligatory duties on account of bodily pain is nothing short of sacrificing the spirit for the sake of the body.\nThe Teacher of the Gita declares that the Rajasic Tyagi does not obtain the merit of renunciation by such abandonment of action.\nBhagavad Gita 18.8 to 18.12 by Swami Chetanananda",

Therefore, working without concern for any reward flowing from it, is the best method of life. He is not bound by action. He alone is called the real Tyagi.\nWe understand clearly that Tyaga definitely means the renunciation of the fruits of action and not the actions.\nThere should not be any sense of doership; there should not be any secret longing to enjoy the fruits of work. No one can be a tyagi by simply giving up work, nor can he obtain the merit of renunciation. Performing all works and yet being unconcerned with fruits is the characteristic feature of the true Tyagi. Abandoning external objects is not Tyaga. The abandoning of the mental attitude, the internal thought of enjoyment, is the ‘sine quo non’ of true Tyaga. Therefore, the Lord’s command is to carry out all prescribed duties in a selfless detached spirit.\nSri Ramakrishna Says —\nMASTER (\nto Hazra\n):\n“What you are doing is right in principle, but the application is not quite correct. Don’t find fault with anyone, not even with an insect. As you pray to God for devotion, so also pray that you may not find fault with anyone.”\nHAZRA:\n“Does God listen to our prayer for bhakti?”\nMASTER:\n“Surely. I can assure you of that a hundred times. But the prayer must be genuine and earnest. Do worldly-minded people weep for God as they do for wife and children? At Kamarpukur the wife of a certain man fell ill. The man thought she would not recover; he began to tremble and was about to faint. Who feels that way for God?”\nHazra was about to take the dust of the Master’s feet.\nMASTER (\nshrinking\n):\n“What is this?”\nHAZRA:\n“Why should I not take the dust of his feet who has so kindly kept me with him?”\nMASTER:\n“Satisfy God and everyone will be satisfied. ‘If He is pleased the world is pleased.’ Once the Lord ate a few greens from Draupadi’s cooking-pot and said, ‘Ah, I am satisfied.’ Immediately the whole world and all its living beings were satisfied; they felt as if they had eaten their fill.\n(\nBG 15.14\n) But was the world satisfied or did it feel that way when the rishis ate their food?\n(\nTo Hazra\n) “\nA perfect soul, even after attaining Knowledge, practises devotions or observes religious ceremonies to set an example to others.\n(\nBG 3.26\n) I go to the Kali temple and I bow before the holy pictures in my room; therefore others do the same. Further, if a man has become habituated to such ceremonies, he feels restless if he does not observe them.\n“One day I saw a sannyasi under the banyan-tree. He had put the salagram on the same carpet with his guru’s sandals. He was worshipping them. I said to him, ‘If you have attained Knowledge to that extent,\n8\nthen why such formal worship at all?’ He replied: ‘What difference does it make? Since I do everything else, why not this too? Sometimes I offer the flowers at the guru’s feet and sometimes to God.’\n“One cannot renounce work as long as one has a body. As long as there is mud at the bottom of the lake, bubbles will be produced. (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\n—–\n“How long should a man perform his duties? As long as he identifies himself with the body, in other words, as long as he thinks he is the body. That is what the\nGita\nsays. To think of the body as the Atman is ajnana, ignorance.\n(\nTo the bearded Brahmo devotee from Shibpur\n) “Are you a Brahmo?”\nDEVOTEE: “Yes, sir.”\nMASTER (\nsmiling\n): “I can recognize a worshipper of the Formless by looking at his face and eyes. Please dive a little deeper. One doesn’t get the gem by floating on the surface. As for myself, I accept all — the formless God and God with form.”\nThe Marwari devotees from Burrabazar entered the room and saluted the Master. He began to praise them.\nMASTER (\nto the devotees\n): “Ah! They are real devotees of God. They visit temples, sing hymns to God, and eat prasad. And the gentleman whom they have made their priest this year is learned in the\nBhagavata\n.”\nMARWARI DEVOTEE: “Who is this ‘I’ that says, ‘O Lord, I am Thy servant’?”\nMASTER: “This is the lingasarira, or embodied soul. It consists of manas, buddhi, chitta, and ahamkara.”\nDEVOTEE: “Who is the embodied soul?”\nMASTER: “It is the Atman bound by the eight fetters. And what is the chitta? It is the ‘I consciousness’ that says, ‘Aha!'”\nDEVOTEE: “Revered sir, what happens after death?”\nMASTER:\n“According to the\nGita\n, one becomes afterwards what one thinks of at the time of death. King Bharata thought of his deer and became a deer in his next life. Therefore one must practise sadhana in order to realise God. If a man thinks of God day and night, he will have the same thought in the hour of death.” (\nBG 8.5\n)\nDEVOTEE:\n“Why don’t we feel dispassion toward worldly objects?”\nMASTER:\n“Because of maya. Through maya one feels the Real to be the unreal and the unreal to be the Real. The Real means That which is eternal, the Supreme Brahman; and the unreal means that which is non-eternal, that is to say, the world.”\nDEVOTEE:\n“We read the scriptures. Why is it that we can’t assimilate them?”\nMASTER: “What will one accomplish by mere reading? One needs spiritual practice — austerity. Call on God. What is the use of merely repeating the word ‘siddhi’? One must eat a little of it.\n“The hand bleeds when it touches a thorny plant. Suppose you bring such a plant and repeat, sitting near it: ‘There! The plant is burning.’ Will that burn the plant? This world is like the thorny plant. Light the fire of Knowledge and with it set the plant ablaze. Only then will it be burnt up.\n“One must labour a little while at the stage of sadhana. Then the path becomes easy. Steer the boat around the curves of the river and then let it go with the favourable wind. (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)",

    "commentary": "The Lord further elaborates on the theme of non-attachment in action. This verse is an answer to those who argue that action should be abandoned because it causes future birth.\nTo whom does Karma cause bondage? Not for all; Karma binds only those who have a sense of doership (Kartrtvabhavana) who have a desire for enjoying the fruits of work.\nBut for those who have abandoned both these, Karma has no power to bind them in any way.\nThreefold is the fruits of action. Evil actions cause low births like beasts and reptiles etc. Good actions cause higher births in the Devaloka. And action mixed with evil and good produce human birth. Such is the effect of action according to its nature. But these effects are felt only by those who are attached to work. They reap the good and evil effects of their actions in future birth after death.\nBut these effects are neutralised by the wise man who has no desire for enjoyment either here or hereafter, who has, therefore, no attachment for the fruits of actions, and who is freed from the delusion of egotism and doership. The word ‘kvachit’ implies that at no time is the Tyagi affected by the work which he has performed. He attains Moksha by the very power of his renunciation. There is no question of a future birth for him. The whole machinery of birth and death stops for him, or he has got out of the terrible wheel of samsara. How wonderful is the reward of Nishkamakarma! How the Lord loves this holy path to self-realisation!\nBhagavad Gita: Chapter 18 🔻 (78 Verses)\n01\n02\n03\n04\n05\n06\n07\n08\n09\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n61\n62\n63\n64\n65\n66\n67\n68\n69\n70\n71\n72\n73\n74\n75\n76\n77\n78",

The word ‘kritante’ is used in the sense that when the knowledge of the Self arises, all actions terminate. In the Vedanta Sastra, (in the Upanishads), Atma is declared to be distinct from and transcending Prakriti, and all actions are performed by Prakriti only, and Atma remains as the eternal witness. The Vedanta is the termination of all Karma. “Sarvam Karmakhilam Partha Jnane Parisamapyate” With the knowledge of the Self all actions come to end, all Karma culminates in jnana. When the Atmic state is realised, the mind, senses and the body cease to exist, and so there cannot be any action whatsoever. That state is beyond Karma. Action can take place only at the lower planes of body and mind. When they are transcended by Atma-jnana, action automatically comes to an end. That is the reason why the word ‘Kritanta’ is used for the Vedanta Sastra, which teaches Atmajnana.\nBhagavad Gita 18.13 to 18.14 by Swami Chetanananda",

Learning and scholarship mastery of all worldly sciences and arts do not confer Atmajnana, and so they remain in the realm of ‘Avidya’ and cannot perceive the truth of Atma. They are blind, having eyes; they are perversed having intelligence; they are men of little understanding, having read many things in the world. They are groping in darkness, in spite of all the light that they have gathered about the world. The Self is not understood by them. Atmajnana alone clears all the doubts and perversities of the body and mind. Nothing can take man beyond Samsara exçept Self-realisation. All the name and fame that man acquires is so much rubbish compared to the realisation of truth, for truth alone confers true joy, freedom and perfection. The Lord is pleased with those who strive to know the Truth. To win popularity among fellow beings is an ordinary thing, and to win the grace of God is a higher achievement.\nThe Lord is perfectly clear when he declares the purity and uncontaminated perfection of Atma. To understand it and realise Atma is the duty of all aspirants.\nTo consider Atma as the doer is evil; the cause of evil is the mind not trained by the study of the Sastras, the fruit of evil is the blindness of ignorance.",

    "translation": "Who is free from the egoistic notion (“I am the doer”), whose intellect is not tainted (by contact with objects and functions), though having slain all the beings, he does not slay, nor is he bound (by the evil of action).",
    "commentary": "It is declared here that the man who has no sense of doership (“I am doing this or that”), whose intellect is not contaminated by anything material, is not affected by evil though he slays all the beings in the world. This verse has to be understood correctly and interpreted very carefully. Otherwise, man verily falls into the bottomless pit of ignorance.\nThe cause of Karmic bondage is the sense of doership and personal agency in all actions. The attachment of the deluded intellect to material objects is also the cause of bondage.\nWhen the false sense of agency and attachment are left behind, action has no power to bind man.\nGood and evil arising from action cannot affect man. This truth is declared here. It certainly does not mean that man can kill people and escape punishment. How can the man of Atmasakshatkara, who sees everything as Atma, who knows that he is not the doer, who is unattached, who is established in the self, and who looks upon all beings as his own Self, cause injury to others? He thinks and works for the well-being of all beings. He becomes ‘sarva bhutahiteratah’. If anybody thinks and acts otherwise, he is not a Self-realised sage.\nIn fact, man is not the body, and not the mind. He is Atma. When there is no feeling of doership and egotism, he has his life and being in the Self. Thus he is not touched by actions performed by the intellect or the body. Therefore though he slays others, he is not the slayer. This Truth is declared emphatically. The Lord wants to emphasise the absolutely pure and perfect nature of Atma, which is independent of every phenomenal change.\nGood and evil arise from action done with a feeling of personal doership.\nDescending from the Atmic state, man identifies himself with the mind and body, and hence he gets bound by his own actions.\nFreed from this delusion, man knows that he is the Atma, the eternal actionless Self. There is no ‘punya’ or ‘papa’ for him. He has gone beyond good and evil. Any amount of good does not bind him, and so also no amount of evil can come to him. For that man the little ‘I’ is dead and gone, and so there is neither the doer nor the enjoyer.\nArjuna, being a Kshatriya, has the duty prescribed by the Sastras to protect the righteous and destroy the wicked. The Kauravas should be slain for their unrighteousness. The Lord says to the warrior-disciple, “O Arjuna! fight the battle and slay the Kauravas, but do so knowing fully that you are not the personal agent of action, that you are in truth the Eternal Self. Then you shall remain free”. Thus here is the Lord’s reply to Arjuna’s original doubt – “How can I kill my own people ?”\nThe freedom of Atma from all good and evil is the Truth. Those who have reached that state have gone beyond both. And yet, let it be firmly known that when the Atmajnani acts using the lower instruments, his actions are full of compassion for mankind. His hands do only good work. His mind thinks only good thoughts. His lips speak only good words, benedictions for all. He acts, if he so desires, for the welfare of all beings. Here is the real test of Atmajnana. Evil cannot dare come anywhere near him. He is like the lion of whom the lower beasts are afraid and come not near. Let the aspirants bear this clearly in mind and test their knowledge by the purity of their thoughts and actions. Let them not fall into the error of claiming Atmic freedom and plunging into the evils of sensual enjoyments.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda\nSri Ramakrishna Says —\nThe Master was gradually regaining consciousness of the outer world. Looking at the devotees he said: “Years ago I used to be amazed to see people keeping kai fish alive in a pot of water. I would say: ‘How cruel these people are! They will finally kill the fish.’ But later, as changes came over my mind, I realised that bodies are like pillow-cases. It doesn’t matter whether they remain or drop off.”\nBHAVANATH:\n“Then may one injure a man without incurring sin? Kill him?”\nMASTER:\n“Yes, it is permissible if one has achieved that state of mind, But not everyone has it. It is the state of Brahmajnana.\n“By coming down a step or two from samadhi I enjoy bhakti and bhakta. “There exist in God both vidya and avidya. Vidyamaya leads one to God, and avidyamaya away from Him. Knowledge, devotion, compassion; and renunciation belong to the realm of vidya. With the help of these a man comes near God. One step more and he attains God, Knowledge of Brahman. In that state he clearly feels and sees that it is God who has become everything. He has nothing to give up and nothing to accept. It is impossible tor him to be angry with anyone. …..\n(\nTo Ram\n) “You are a physician. You know that medicine works only when it mixes with the patient’s blood and becomes one with it. Likewise, in the state of Brahmajnana one sees God both within and without. One sees that it is God Himself who has become the body, mind, life, and soul.”\nM. (\nto himself\n): “Assimilation!”\nMASTER:\n“A man attains Brahmajnana as soon as his mind is annihilated. With the annihilation of the mind dies the ego, which says ‘I’, ‘I’. One also attains the Knowledge of Brahman by following the path of devotion. One also attains It by following the path of knowledge, that is to say, discrimination. The jnanis discriminate, saying, ‘Neti, neti’, that is, ‘All this is illusory, like a dream.’ They analyse the world through the process of ‘Not this, not this’; it is maya. When the world vanishes, only the jivas, that is to say, so many egos, remain.\n“Each ego may be likened to a pot. Suppose there are ten pots filled with water, and the sun is reflected in them. How many suns do you see?”\nA DEVOTEE:\n“Ten reflections. Besides, there certainly exists the real sun.”\nMASTER:\n“Suppose you break one pot. How many suns do you see now?”\nDEVOTEE:\n“Nine reflected suns. But there certainly exists the real Sun.”\nMASTER:\n“All right. Suppose you break nine pots. How many suns do you see now?”\nDEVOTEE:\n“One reflected sun. But there certainly exists the real sun.”\nMASTER (\nto Girish\n):\n“What remains when the last pot is broken?”\nGIRISH:\n“That real sun, sir.”\nMASTER:\n“No. What remains cannot be described. What\nis\nremains. How will you know there is a real sun unless there is a reflected sun? ‘I- consciousness’ is destroyed in samadhi. A man climbing down from samadhi to the lower plane cannot describe what he has seen there.” (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)",

    "translation": "The knowledge by which, man clings to one thing (body or image) as if it were the whole, without reason and foundation in Truth, and which is trivial, that is declared to be Tamasic (Jnana).",
    "commentary": "Tamasic Jnana is narrow and blind. The man attaches himself to one single thing considering it to be the whole. Such narrowness is the result of ignorance. Attached to money, the greedy man considers it as the whole of the universe; attached to lust, the immoral man clings to the body as the whole of life; attached to some doll, the ignorant man considers it as the whole Truth. Thus we find that a single thing occupies the entire being. Besides, it is a trivial thing producing very little result. It is a thing which has no basis in Truth. Thus Tamasic jnana is narrow and blind to Truth. He sees matter and thinks there is nothing beyond it.\nRajasic knowledge is higher; He sees many things distinctly and separately. His vision goes deeper into the qualities of each thing which divides one from another. But he has not yet arrived at the basic Reality. He loses himself in multiplicity and manifoldness and sees separateness everywhere.\nSattvic knowledge reveals the basic Truth of the One Indivisible Atma pervading the whole universe. In all things, he sees the One Atma. The external coatings of matter, colour, size, and qualities are all transcended and the one\nSat\nappears to him in everything. Arriving at this knowledge of Oneness, man knows the ultimate truth and is no longer deluded. He attains Atma, and goes beyond the cycle of birth and death. In the midst of the many, who sees the One – he alone sees (Knows the Truth about himself and everything in the universe).",

    "translation": "Ordained by the Sastras, that action, performed by one not desirous of the fruit, without attachment, free from love and hate, is called Sattvic karma.",
    "commentary": "Wherever the word ‘karma’ is used, the Lord invariably employs the attribute ‘niyatam’ or its equivalent, thereby emphasising the authority of the Sastras about all the activities of mankind. No one should consider his personal opinion as the measure of Truth. Every seeker should know what is ordained in the Sastras, examine it by personal experience, and then act rightly in all matters. Half-digested notions, fanciful theories, personal likes and dislikes, are nowadays taken as basic truths by individual members of society. Independent judgment has come down to the level of personal feelings of men who are subject to a hundred vile passions and prejudices. So, without deluding oneself by clinging to his own views, notions, and opinions, men should act according to the Sastras, as the Sastras embody the combined wisdom of sages who have gone beyond ‘raga’ and dvesha’, and whose only aim is to work for the welfare of humanity.\nAs no man can live without action, as action is life itself as we see, it is necessary to know the principles of action.\nAction should be as prescribed by the Sastras.\nIt should be performed without attachment, without any feeling of doership.\nIt should be performed without attraction or aversion\nIt should be performed without desire for the fruit.\nThis is the four-way test of Sattvic action. It purifies the mind, washes away the evils of the heart, corrects all defects, confers knowledge, and leads to Moksha.\nFormerly, the Lord has declared that action should be without the sense of doership ‘\nSangarahitam\n‘ and also the actor should be free from the taint of egotism. There should not be the feeling “I am doing this or that, this is my work”. This is the secret of work. Such work does not blind. The message of the Gita is this secret of work.\nThe call to action and the way how to perform the action, are the chief instructions of the Gita.",

It is performed with great effort (bahulayasam).\nThe passionate man burdens himself with work that causes unnecessary labour and effort. And it implies that the fruit is not commensurate with the effort put into the work The action becomes restless and troubled in the course of the action, because his eye is on the rewards to be obtained from it, and also the pride of having brought the action to a successful end. Both these inner motives make the work painful and burdensome. He cannot have the self-sacrifice of the Sattvic man, who performs equally great action but without losing his balance and equanimity. He acts because the Sastras have sanctioned the action, and is not conscious of any personal feeling or attachment to its end. He is, therefore, free and joyous. Desire for reward is bondage; egoism is bondage. The seekers should learn to avoid these two great evils which bind the self to the wheel of Karma.",

    "translation": "An actor agent who is freed from attachment, non-egotistic, unaffected in success and failure, endued with firmness and enthusiasm, is called Sattvic (Karta).",
    "commentary": "As man is constantly acting in everyday life, it is necessary for him to know what the best qualities of an agent should be. Here, four conditions are prescribed for the Sattvic agent.\n1. He should be free from longing for the fruits of his work. This detachment enables the agent to maintain his freedom in the midst of the work he is doing. In fact, it is this spirit of freedom which is to be safeguarded at every turn in this course of earthly life. Freedom is the very essence of spiritual realisation.\n2. The absence of the egotistic feeling ‘I am the doer; I am doing this or that is the second quality of the Sattvic agent. It is a clear perception that all action is performed only by the Gunas and the instruments of action. When a man attains this clearness of understanding, he is finally aware that he is not the real actor or agent. He has no egotistic feeling. He remains a witness of all that he is doing with his body, senses and mind.\n3. The third attribute of the Sattvic agent is firmness and enthusiasm. Timidity and despondence have no place in the spiritual field. Such a man cannot make any progress towards the goal. In fact it was despondence that overtook Arjuna on the battlefield as described in the opening chapter of the Gita. The effects of such low spirits are vividly described there.\nThe message of the Gita is to lift up the fallen soul by asserting the inherent divinity of human beings.\n“I am the ever pure (suddha), intelligent (buddha) free (mukta) Atma”-this thought kept up frequently gives infinite strength and courage to man. In truth, man is not the perishable body or the fickle mind, or the deluded intellect. He is Atma, the indivisible ocean of Sat Chit Ananda. What can frighten and terrify him? So thinking and realising, man moves forward with courage and resolution.\n4. The fourth attribute is equanimity in the midst of success and failure. If failure comes, he is not deterred but strives again and again till success comes to him. The seeker comes across severe hurdles in the course of his journey to the ultimate, but undaunted by obstacles which may appear superhuman, he moves forward, for he knows that the spirit shall finally triumph over matter. Thus the Sattvic agent is firm as a rock in the midst of the trials and shocks of life. He is full of hope and courage. He knows the ephemeral nature of the world and the reality of the Self, transcending all that is phenomenal in this world and in all the worlds altogether.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda\nSri Ramakrishna Says —\n“There are innumerable pathways leading to the Ocean of Immortality. The essential thing is to reach the Ocean. It doesn’t matter which path you follow. Imagine that there is a reservoir containing the Elixir of Immortality. You will be immortal if a few drops of the Elixir somehow get into your mouth. You may get into the reservoir either by jumping into it, or by being pushed into it from behind, or by slowly walking down the steps. The effect is one and the same. You will become immortal by tasting a drop of that Elixir.\n“Innumerable are the ways that lead to God. There are the paths of jnana, of karma, and of bhakti. If you are sincere, you will attain God in the end, whichever path you follow. Roughly speaking, there are three kinds of yoga: jnanayoga, karmayoga, and bhaktiyoga.\n“What is jnanayoga? The jnani seeks to realise Brahman. He discriminates, saying, ‘Not this, not this’. He discriminates, saying, ‘Brahman is real and the universe illusory.’ He discriminates between the Real and the unreal. As he comes to the end of discrimination, he goes into samadhi and attains the Knowledge of Brahman.\n“What is karmayoga? Its aim is to fix one’s mind on God by means of work. That is what you are teaching. It consists of breath-control, (Breathing exercises as prescribed in rajayoga.) concentration, meditation, and so on, done in a spirit of detachment. If a house- holder performs his duties in the world in a spirit of detachment, surrendering the results to God and with devotion to God in his heart, he too may be said to practise karmayoga. Further, if a person performs worship, japa, and other forms of devotion, surrendering the results to God, he may be said to practise karmayoga. Attainment of God alone is the aim of karmayoga.\n“What is bhaktiyoga? It is to keep the mind on God by chanting His name and glories. For the Kaliyuga the path of devotion is easiest. This is indeed the path for this age.\n“The path of karma is very difficult. First of all, as I have just said, where will one find the time for it nowadays? Where is the time for a man to perform his duties as enjoined in the scriptures? Man’s life is short in this age. Further,\nit is extremely difficult to perform one’s duties in a spirit of detachment, without craving the result. One cannot work in such a spirit without first having realised God. Attachment to the result somehow enters the mind, though you may not be aware of it.\n“To follow jnanayoga in this age is also very difficult. First, a man’s life depends entirely on food. Second, he has a short span of life. Third, he can by no means get rid of body-consciousness; and the Knowledge of Brahman is impossible without the destruction of body-consciousness. The jnani says: ‘I am Brahman; I am not the body. I am beyond hunger and thirst, disease and grief, birth and death, pleasure and pain.’ How can you be a jnani if you are conscious of disease, grief, pain, pleasure, and the like? A thorn enters your flesh, blood flows from the wound, and you suffer very badly from the pain; but nevertheless if you are a jnani you must be able to say: ‘Why, there is no thorn in my flesh at all. Nothing is the matter with me.’\n“Therefore bhaktiyoga is prescribed for this age. By following this path one comes to God more easily than by following the others. One can undoubtedly reach God by following the paths of jnana and karma, but they are very difficult paths.\n“Bhaktiyoga is the religion for this age. But that does not mean that the lover of God will reach one goal and the philosopher and worker another. It means that if a person seeks the Knowledge of Brahman he can attain It by following the path of bhakti, too. God, who loves His devotee, can give him the Knowledge of Brahman if He so desires.\n“But the bhakta wants to realise the Personal God endowed with form and talk to Him. He seldom seeks the Knowledge of Brahman. But God, who does everything at His pleasure, can make His devotee the heir to His infinite glories if it pleases Him. He gives His devotee both the Love of God and the Knowledge of Brahman. If one is able somehow to reach Calcutta, one can see the Maidan and the museum and other places too. The thing is how to reach Calcutta.\n“By realizing the Divine Mother of the Universe, you will get Knowledge (\nBG 10.11\n) as well as Devotion. You will get both. In bhava samadhi you will see the form of God, and in nirvikalpa samadhi you will realise Brahman, the Absolute Existence-Knowledge-Bliss. In nirvikalpa samadhi ego, name, and form do not exist.\n“A lover of God prays to the Divine Mother: ‘O Mother, I am very much afraid of selfish actions. Such actions have desires behind them, and if I perform them I shall have to reap their fruit. But it is very difficult to work in a detached spirit. I shall certainly forget Thee, O Mother, if I involve myself in selfish actions. Therefore I have no use for them. “May my actions, O Divine Mother, be fewer every day till I attain Thee. May I perform, without attachment to the results, only what action is absolutely necessary for me. May I have great love for Thee as I go on with my few duties. May I not entangle myself in new work so long as I do not realise Thee. But I shall perform it if I receive Thy command. Otherwise not.'” (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\nRelated Articles:\nFree from pride and delusion, having conquered the evil of attachment, ever devoted to the Supreme Self, with desires completely stilled, liberated from the pairs of opposites known as pleasure and pain, the undeluded reach that Immutable Goal.

The unreal world and the body appear real to them, and the Supreme Reality Atma is non-existent (to them). 2.

    "translation": "O Arjuna! that unswerving firmness which, by Yoga, holds the functions of the mind, Prana, and bodily organs, is called Sattvic (pure).",
    "commentary": "Firm courage is exhibited by men in various directions in the world. Some fight harmless, some roam about freely in dark and dangerous forests, some climb mountain peaks, some reach the moon in rockets, and so on. We are able to see and understand this style of courage and firmness. But here, the firm holding of the internal forces is explained. The mind, the vital forces, the external and internal instruments of the body, should be held, and controlled, by unswerving Yogic concentration. This is Sattvic Dhriti’. The yogi is determined to conquer the whole of the inner universe and keep it under his control. He draws the mind back from the innumerable temptations of the sense-enjoyment; he frees himself from the tremendous delusion of the objective universe. This is Sattvic courage and firmness. Besides worldly courage which helps man to overcome external difficulties and dangers, one should cultivate firmness of Yoga in the conquest of the internal forces.\nThis courage should be unswerving, firm, and immovable. Therefore it is described as ‘\navyabhicharinya\n‘. We see that the courage of renunciation is strong sometimes and weak at other times. It stays for some period and when its hold is loosened, the seeker once again reverts to the old enslaved way of life. Such sporadic fits of courage or firmness are not of much use in the spiritual path. So, it is declared by the Lord that the Sattvic Dhriti’ is unswerving, firm, immovable under all circumstances.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda",

He should strive to cultivate kindness, compassion, devotion, and knowledge, and acquire God’s grace. Sage Valmiki at first misused his faculties in evil ways.

    "translation": "O Arjuna! and now hear from Me the three-fold pleasure in which man finds delight by habit, and attains to the end of pain.",
    "commentary": "abhyasat:\nThe Lord declares that divine happiness (Brahmananda) is to be attained by practice. Realisation does not come to man by mere learning of the power of speech. It is a practical science and should be understood by personal experience. Then alone man realises esteemed peace and bliss. Many people ask the question-“How can we realise Atma, transcend pain and suffering, and attain bliss”? The Lord answers the question here. “Practice, and you shall attain that state,” says the Lord. Nothing can be achieved by mere talk and mere study of books. You can get butter only by churning the curd. You can get sweet juice only by crushing the sugar cane. You can get oil only by crushing the seeds. Therefore, by practice alone man can come to the end of pain and attain bliss.\nDukhantam cha nigacchati:\nThis is the fundamental question for all living beings. Where is true joy and how is it to be attained? From the lowest germs and worms up to the creator Brahma, this question is asked, and the answer to this question is escaping mankind in spite of repeated efforts to find it. Where is the place to search for true joy? Is it anywhere in the world? Can these objects of the material universe give it? Can anybody purchase true joy with money or lands or kingdoms? Man is searching for it with all his skill and intelligence. But he is not able to find it anywhere in the material objective world. True joy is only in Atma, in the Divine. Man finds true joy when the mind attains the state of true Sattva. The moment when the mind reaches the Sattvic state, all sorrow comes to an end. So, the Lord’s declaration should be constantly kept in mind, and man should know clearly that all Rajasic and Tamasic tendencies and actions lead to pain and sorrow. Thus knowing, he should strive his best to keep the mind in the Sattvic state and experience the bliss of Atma. By the constant practice of Divine virtues, by eliminating the ego, by constant contemplation of the real Self, man attains true joy which is the very essence of Atma.\nBhagavad Gita 18.36 to 18.39 by Swami Chetanananda",

    "translation": "That pleasure which is like poison at first but in the end is like nectar, born of the purity of one’s own mind of Self-realisation, is declared to be Sattvic.",
    "commentary": "In the spiritual life, the practice of self-restraint, mind-control, and the destruction of impure tendencies produce a slight feeling of unrest, physical and mental pain. But the pain is turned into pure joy in the end. As the seeker acquires facility in sadhana, he begins to experience Sattvic joy. This is like nectar. The aspirant should never forget that the pain which he is enduring will yield the richest and the most plentiful joy in the end. So he should remain strong and determined and should not waver in continuing his sadhana. The pain is like poison, and certainly not poison (\nvisham iva\n). The struggle with the impure tendencies accumulated in innumerable past births would be naturally severe and painful, but the pain is only apparent and not real. This should be clearly kept in mind so that the seeker is not depressed by the painful experience of self-discipline in the early stages of the sadhana.\nThe struggle is inevitable. It is a part of spiritual life and no one can hope to attain the highest without going through the conflict between the lower and higher natures. But one can rest assured that the higher nature is the real power behind everything and so it shall come out victorious at the end, however deep-rooted the impure vasanas might be in the mind of the Sadhaka.\nThe apparent pain of self-denial is only the prelude to the attainment of Brahmananda.\nFor certain diseases, very bitter medicines are administered. Though the medicine is bitter to the taste, it gives good health. One has to take the medicine for his own good. When a shapeless stone is transformed into a beautiful image of God, it receives the hard knocks of the sculptor’s hammer. When a lump of gold is transformed into a beautiful ornament, it receives the sharp strokes of the jeweler’s hammer. So also to attain Brahmananda man has to practice self-denial and sacrifice. The little sense pleasures which man gives up give him some pain in the beginning. They have been with him as relation in home during a long series of births. When they are given up, some slight pain is caused as when a dear relation passes away. The Sadhaka should not be disheartened. A little persistence and pursuance will bring about the necessary change and when the difficulty passes away the joy of the spirit begins to manifest slowly.\nHard work and study in student-life results in prosperity and joy in later life. We see that in the lives of many people. So also in spiritual life, the aspirant has to endure some initial discomfort and pain, and move forward with firm determination. He should not be deterred by the obstacles of the early passing phase. That is why the Lord here declares that ‘sattvic happiness’ which apparently appears painful contains the seeds of divine bliss. To throw away the inherent divine bliss by fear of external discomforts would be very foolish. So, the seekers should constantly remind themselves of the pure bliss that awaits them when the initial obstacles are overcome by firm resistance, and indomitable will. One should be a hero on the spiritual path. The Upanishads declare that only a hero (Dhirah) can obtain the vision of Paramatma. The lives of Lord Buddha, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, and others reveal this truth. This Atmic bliss is not like the drink of the Gods which enables them to live longer than the mortals. It is pure nectar, conferring everlasting bliss unaffected by anything whatsoever. It takes mankind beyond the whirlpool of birth and death and establishes the original state of freedom and perfection.\nAtmabuddhi prasadajam:\nThis Sattvic joy is born of the purity of the intellect, freed from all sensual contacts, pleasures, and delusions. So, the seeker should keep the ‘buddhi’ clean and clear, and thus he perceives and experiences the bliss of Atma. Freedom from all sorrow and suffering is not to be found everywhere in the upper or the underworlds. It is directly present in the purified ‘Buddhi’. Maharshi Vasishta declares the same truth in\nYogavasishta\n.",

    "translation": "That pleasure arising from contact of the sense organs with the objects, which is like the nectar at first and which in effect is like poison, is declared to be\nRajasic\n.",
    "commentary": "Sense pleasures are momentary. They are produced by the contact of sense organs with material objects. Moreover, the sense-pleasures, though they appear sweet and attractive on the surface, lead to pain, sorrow, and suffering in the end. So, Rajasic pleasure is like a cup of poison with a thin film of milk over it. It is dangerous and fatal to seek it. Man is deluded by the superficial glitter and glamour of sense attractions and rushes to his own destruction by running after them with foolish zeal and enthusiasm. Knowing it as such, who will pursue them? Who will love them? Who will hanker after them? The wise man takes the hint from the Lord’s command and abandons all unworthy ends and purpose in life.\nAll that glitters is not gold. The glitter of sense-pleasures is easily understood even by an uncritical mind in the daily course of human life. What is necessary is to pause for a moment and enquire into the nature of such pleasure and its consequence. Such enquiry repeatedly carried out will enable the seeker to know the true nature of the sense pleasures, and when it is known the mind ceases to run after them. Of course, by the force of past samskaras, man runs after such pleasures, and so a persistent and resolute effort is to be made to clear up the rubbish and make the mind clean and pure. Repeated efforts alone can turn the mind back from pursuing external objects. The path may be difficult, but not impossible. The Lord will sustain the effort of man and give him the necessary strength. Such is the Lord’s assurance to the sincere seeker. No defeat, no despair, no pessimism, no lethargy can overtake the man of steady and unswerving faith.",

Their life is devoid of understanding. Precious human life is then wasted in beastly pleasures. The seed of ignorance continues to exert its power over man, and drives him on from birth to birth, every time drawing man on the downward path of destruction. Therefore, those who are enlightened should follow the Lord’s command and abandon all Tamasic and Rajasic pleasures. Holding on to Sattva, man should purify himself and rise to the highest state.",

Here again, the Lord states that the difference among the castes is due to qualities differently exhibited according to their nature. So, the accident of birth is not the real criterion to fix the special gradation of the caste system. It shows that caste is no bar for anyone who aspires for Self-realisation. Though the birth is apparently in the lower castes, man can ascend to great spiritual heights by the purity of his character and conducts. The Gita thus throws open the gates of Brahmajnana to all people who are qualified for it by virtue of their inherent predispositions and acquired merit. The accident of birth is of very little significance.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda",

By performing one’s own duties without attachment to the fruits, man releases himself from the binding effects of Karma which is the cause of Samsara. Since the majority of men are compelled by their very nature to engage themselves in their respective duties, the best way for such is to continue their work in a spirit of self-surrender to the Lord. By such detached action, the mind is purified and the Self is realised. Thus Karma is the way to Atmajnana through the purification of the mind.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda\nSwami Vivekananda Says —\nThe Bhagavad Gita frequently alludes to duties dependent upon birth and position in life. Birth and position in life and in society largely determine the mental and moral attitude of individuals towards the various activities of life. It is therefore our duty to do that work which will exalt and ennoble us in accordance with the ideals and activities of the society in which we are born.\n[Source]\n)",

    "translation": "By performing one’s natural occupation, one worships the Creator from whom all living entities have come into being, and by whom the whole universe is pervaded. By such performance of work, a person easily attains perfection.",
    "commentary": "Yatah pravrittir bhutanam:\nIt is clear that Paramatma is the origin and source of all beings. All beings come from Him and return to Him. Paramatma is the vital Intelligence Principle without which insentient Prakriti can do nothing. Therefore the worship of Paramatma is the highest duty of man in whom Paramatma is manifesting in the highest degree.\nYena saravam idam tatam:\nAll this is pervaded by the Lord. This declaration is made thrice in the Gita. Paramatma is present everywhere, like cream in milk. He is not seen with the external eye, but to the eye of knowledge, He is visible. He is ‘Sarvasakshi’, the Seer of everything because He is present in the innermost core of every being. So realising, man should be pure in thought and deed and should be devoted to Him who is the origin and source of his very being.\nSvakarmana tam abhyarcha:\nThe performance of one’s own duty is itself the worship of the Lord. This is the excellence of Kamayoga. The tiller in the field, the worker in the factory, the judge in the court, the minister in the cabinet, the trader, the cobbler, in fact, every man who is engaged in some form of work or other, can transform and sublimate that work into the worship of the Lord by offering it to Him-the action and its fruits altogether. Thus every step that he takes, every breath that he breathes, every action that he does becomes worship of the Lord. Such worship automatically purifies the mind, because the mind is agitated only when man becomes attached to his work for selfish ends and by selfish motives. He who can maintain the attitude of detachment and surrender remains restful and lives in peace. Such peace leads to the vision of Paramatma. Of all the methods mentioned to purify the mind, this is the best and most easy to practice. As man is engaged in some form of work, the ideal is to perform it as worship of the Lord, free from fear and anxiety, free from binding egotism and binding selfishness.\nThus Karma becomes the means to Moksha. Karma binds only when the performer desires to obtain this or that fruit either in this world or in other worlds. Man knows in his heart of hearts that he is attached to work by contemplating the pleasure of enjoying the rewards. This should be given up by the true seeker whose will is set on the realisation of ultimate perfection. The Lord declares that man attains perfection by following the principle of detached performance of one’s own duty.\nThis verse explains the combination of Karma, Bhakti, and Jnana.\nPerformance of action (Karma)\nWorship of the Lord through action (Bhakti)\nPurification of the mind which brings about self-realisation (Jnana)\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda",

    "translation": "Better is one’s own duty though destitute of merits or incomplete than the duty of another well performed; the man who performs action ordained by his own nature does not incur sin.",
    "commentary": "The Lord declares that one should not give up his prescribed duty though it appears difficult to perform it fully and completely. The duties of another man appear easy and attractive, but the true seeker should stick to his own method and way of life. This is certainly better than abandoning one’s own duty and taking up another’s and doing it even meritoriously. We have to refer this statement to Arjuna’s original plea to abandon fighting and to live the life of a mendicant. Arjuna is a Kshatriya and his duty born of his own nature is to fight. He should not give up this duty. He should perform it in the true spirit of a Karma-Yogi. By doing so, he does not incur sin. The principle holds good to all men engaged in various forms of work each according to his nature.\nThe verse may be interpreted in another way. ‘Svadharma’ may be taken to mean Atma dharma’. To think of Atma and meditate on that may appear difficult, and living the life of the senses in the objective world may be easy. But the real seeker should continue the ‘Atma-dharma’ in spite of difficulties and failures. In fact, Atma-dharma’ is the real state of man, and life in the senses and the objective world is an alien imposition,- ‘\nparadharma\n‘. Though ‘\nparadharma\n‘ appears easy and pleasing for the time being, it leads to bondage and sorrow in the end. ‘Atma-dharma’ on the other hand, though appearing to be difficult and troublesome in the beginning, leads to bliss and liberation in the end. So ‘Atma-dharma’ is infinitely better than ‘\nParadharma\n‘. in the end.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda\nOne should not condemn any method practised by a person who genuinely believes in his heart of hearts that it will enable him to realize God. The spiritual attitude of no one should be interfered with. For, if one rightly grasps any attitude, through it alone one can realize the divine Lord, who is the embodiment of all attitudes. Stick to your own attitude and continue calling on Him. But never condemn anybody’s attitude nor try to make another’s attitude your own.\n— Sri Ramakrishna (Source: Sri Ramakrishna The Great Master)\n—–\nThe Master (Sri Ramakrishna) established relationships with devotees according to their natures. The Master established a particular spiritual relationship with each devotee based on that person’s inner nature. He used to say, “I see vividly what is inside human beings, as one sees the items in a glass case.” A person can never act contrary to his or her nature, so the devotees were incapable of acting in a way inconsistent with the relationship adopted by the Master.\nIf a man imitated another person, going against his own nature by doing so, the Master would be displeased and would point out that man’s mistake.\nFor example, he used to call Girish “Bhairava” [a form of Shiva]. One day at the Dakshineswar Kali temple when he was in ecstasy, he saw Girish in that form. He put up with Girish’s importunities and harsh words because he could see the wonderful tenderness and complete dependence hidden under the veil of his rough mannerisms. Once another devotee of the Master used that kind of rude language towards him, imitating Girish. The Master was very displeased and later pointed out his error.\nThe Master guided devotees individually along their respective spiritual paths. Established in bhavamukha, the Master had full knowledge of the innate spiritual mood of each man and woman devotee and established a permanent loving relationship with each of them accordingly. (Source: Sri Ramakrishna and His Divine Play)\nThe world is like a vast pharmacy, filled with countless medicines (paths and duties). While every medicine on the shelf is potent and valid in its own right, not every medicine is meant for you.\nIf you are suffering from a fever, you must take the medicine prescribed for fever. To glance at another patient curing their cold with a different medicine, and then blindly consume that same medicine simply because it worked for them, is not only useless—it is dangerous.\nSimilarly, in life, we each have a unique nature (\nSvabhava\n) and a specific duty born of that nature (\nSvadharma\n). To abandon your own natural duty to imitate the path of another—merely because it looks successful or attractive—is spiritual suicide. Just as the wrong medicine poisons the body, the wrong duty disturbs the soul.\nEven if the medicine meant for you tastes bitter (flawed/difficult), it cures you. The sweet syrup meant for someone else (perfectly performed alien duty) will only harm you.\nA doctor prescribes medication based on the patient’s specific constitution. In the same way, your duties are prescribed by your\nSvabhava\n(inner nature). Acting according to your nature creates harmony; acting against it creates “disease” (inner conflict and sin).\nRelated Articles:\nThe Goal and Methods of Realisation – Swami Vivekananda\nOne’s own duty, ill-performed and without merit, is better than the duty of another well-discharged. Better is death in discharging one’s own duty. Another’s duty is fraught with fear.\n—\nBhagavad Gita 3.35",

    "translation": "O Arjuna! One should not abandon the duty to which he is born, though it is attended with evil; all undertakings are indeed enveloped by evil, like fire by smoke.",
    "commentary": "As the action is performed by the senses and the physical organs, it is within the region of the objective world, conditioned by the three Gunas. Therefore all action is attended with some form of evil or other. All action is ‘Anatma’; it is objective, and it is corrupted by Gunas, so all action partakes of evil. Fire is enveloped by smoke. There can be no fire without the covering evil of smoke. In spite of it, one should not abandon the duty to which he is born, because if it is performed with detachment and in a spirit of surrender to the Lord, it purifies the mind and leads to liberation.\nThe inevitable evils attendant in all actions is purified by various rites and rituals. Enquiry into the nature of Brahman, mediation, and other sanctified methods of spiritual practice will wash off the impurities clinging to the mind. Therefore one should continue to act in the condition in which he is placed, without attachment to fruits thereof and in a spirit of self-surrender. That man attains the highest state.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda\nSwami Vivekananda Says —\nWe find that Krishna’s message has also a place for us. Without that message, we cannot move at all. We cannot conscientiously and with peace, joy, and happiness, take up any duty of our lives without listening to the message of Krishna: “Be not afraid even if there is evil in your work, for there is no work which has no evil.” “Leave it unto the Lord, and do not look for the results.”\n[Source]\nThe result of every work is mixed with good and evil. There is no good work that has not a touch of evil in it. Like smoke round the fire, some evil always clings to work. We should engage in such works as bring the largest amount of good and the smallest measure of evil. Arjuna killed Bhishma and Drona; if this had not been done Duryodhana could not have been conquered, the force of evil would have triumphed over the force of good, and thus a great calamity would have fallen on the country. The government of the country would have been usurped by a body of proud unrighteous kings, to the great misfortune of the people. Similarly, Shri Krishna killed Kamsa, Jarasandha, and others who were tyrants, but not a single one of his deeds was done for himself. Every one of them was for the good of others. We are reading the Gita by candle-light, but numbers of insects are being burnt to death. Thus it is seen that some evil clings to work.\n[Source]\nOf course, work is always mixed with good and evil, and to work, one has to incur sin, more or less. But what of that? Let it be so. Is not something better than nothing? Is not insufficient food better than going without any? Is not doing work, though mixed with good and evil, better than doing nothing and passing an idle and inactive life, and being like stones? The cow never tells a lie, and the stone never steals, but, nevertheless, the cow remains a cow and the stone a stone. Man steals and man tells lies, and again it is man that becomes a god.\n[Source]\nThe scriptures of different religions point out different means to attain the ideals of universal love, freedom, manliness, and selfless benevolence. Every religious sect is generally at variance as to its idea of what is virtue and what is vice, and fights with others over the means of attaining virtue and eschewing vice, instead of aiming at realizing the end. Every means is helpful more or less, and the Gita says, “Every undertaking is attended with defects as fire with smoke”; so the means will no doubt appear more or less defective. But as we are to attain the highest virtue through the means laid down in our respective scriptures, we should try our best to follow them. Moreover, they should be tempered with reason and discrimination. Thus, as we progress, the riddle of virtue and vice will be solved by itself.\n[Source]\nIn every country, nations have their good and bad sides. Ours is to do good works in our lives and hold an example before others. No work succeeds by condemnation. It only repels people. Let anybody say what he likes, don’t contradict him. In this world of Maya, whatever work you will take up will be attended with some defect. “All works are covered with defects as fire is with smoke.” Every fire has a chance of being attended with smoke. But will you, on that account, sit inactive? As far as you can, you must go on doing good work.\n[Source]",

Though a man is engaged in the activities of the world with all the senses functioning continuously, if he remembers the Lord or if he surrenders the fruits of his works to the Lord, he obtains the grace of Iswara and liberation comes to him easily. From this, we understand the action performed with true devotion leads man to a state of supreme Bliss. He who takes refuge in the Lord is not bound by any action or by all the actions done continually throughout his life. On the other hand, he breaks the bonds of Karma, for, the binding power of Karma is destroyed by true devotion to the Lord. There is no agency or selfish desire behind such work. Such is of the state of the true devotee whose mind is centered in the Lord and who feels that it is the power of the Lord which is functioning through him. When that attitude of mind is firmly established, man feels not the weight of work, nor the changes of fortune, nor the anxieties of the future.\nJust as the court-dancer carrying on her head a brimful pitcher of water, though talking, singing and dancing, keeps her mind on the pitcher to keep it secure, so also the devotee, while engaged in a thousand activities, keeps his mind fixed on the Lord and attains liberation.\nThe seekers on the path of Karma-yoga should remember this principle. Otherwise, every act binds man to the wheel of Samsara and results in endless strife and suffering. If a man is propelled by selfish desires and performs actions to reap their fruits, he is binding himself with the strongest chains of action and reaction, and birth after birth, he has to undergo all the ills and evils in earthy existence.",

    "commentary": "In his former teaching, the Lord advised Arjuna to give up the idea of doership and fight the righteous war. Now the Lord points out that even if Arjuna resolves to give up action, he cannot do so, for reason that his own nature will compel him to fight against his own resolve not to do so. The great secret behind all action is the sense of non-doership (i.e.) the absence of agency, in the doer. Man must act some way or other by the force of his nature and habit. How then can he be free from the binding effects of his action? The answer is this-By giving up the sense of doership, and renouncing the fruits of action he can be free. This is the essential secret behind all action. One who has attained this feeling of detachment is not bound by anything that he does.\nSwami Vivekananda Says —\nFirst form character, first earn spirituality and results will come of themselves.\n[Source]\n”Each man’s character is determined by the sum total of these impressions. If good impressions prevail, the character becomes good; if bad, it becomes bad. If a man continuously hears bad words, thinks bad thoughts, does bad actions, his mind will be full of bad impressions; and they will influence his thought and work without his being conscious of the fact. In fact, these bad impressions are always working, and their resultant must be evil, and that man will be a bad man; he cannot help it. The sum total of these impressions in him will create the strong motive power for doing bad actions. He will be like a machine in the hands of his impressions, and they will force him to do evil. Similarly, if a man thinks good thoughts and does good works, the sum total of these impressions will be good; and they, in a similar manner, will force him to do good even in spite of himself. When a man has done so much good work and thought so many good thoughts that there is an irresistible tendency in him to do good in spite of himself and even if he wishes to do evil, his mind, as the sum total of his tendencies, will not allow him to do so; the tendencies will turn him back; he is completely under the influence of the good tendencies. When such is the case, a man’s good character is said to be established.\n[Source]\nOne day Sri Ramakrishna wrote on a piece of paper, “Naren will teach people.” When Narendra(Swami Vivekananda) expressed opposition the Master said: “But you must. Your very bones will do it.”\nThe scripture says: Vāsanā pushyati vapuh, desires preserve the body. Human beings have innumerable desires and they force people to move forward. Most people are satisfied when they have fulfilled their worldly desires, and only a rare one among millions seeks God. Chandra Mohan Datta, a young man from Dhaka, came to Calcutta for a job. He heard about the Ramakrishna Mission and came to Udbodhan House, where he met Holy Mother. She listened to him describe his family background and appointed him to do marketing for her household. Saradananda also engaged him to pack books in the publication department. The Mother was very fond of him, because of his simplicity, honesty, and guilelessness. He lived with the monks on the ground floor of the house. He was very fond of eating, and the Mother loved to feed him. Whenever he came to her, he got something to eat.\nSometimes we wonder: if God were to appear to us this moment and offer us a single boon, what would we ask for? Undoubtedly, most people would ask for money, considering that money can fulfill all of their needs. Among millions, perhaps, one would ask for liberation. Chandra Datta once faced this test. He recalled:\nOnce I was about to go for a bath in the Ganges from Udbodhan House. Swamis Shuddhananda and Prajnananda were with me. Suddenly Swami Shuddhananda said to me: “Chandra, you have free access to Holy Mother and she is also very fond of you. Could you go to the Mother and ask something that I tell you?”\n“Of course, I can. Tell me what I have to ask from her.”\n“Nothing much. It is a trivial thing. Just tell her, ‘Mother, I want liberation.’”\n“I shall tell her right now.”\nImmediately I ran to the Mother’s room upstairs and found her worshipping the Master. I had come to her room so many times before, but on that day I was a little scared to see her performing worship. My body began to tremble. I was thinking I should leave the room but I did not have that strength. My legs were shaking, my throat became parched, and my body began to perspire. Suddenly the Mother turned towards me and asked, “Do you want to say something?” My voice choked. Again she asked with a sign, “Did you come to say something?” Quite involuntarily I blurted out one word, “prasad.” The Mother pointed to the prasad kept on a plate under the bed. Then she resumed the worship. Shivering and perspiring profusely, I ran downstairs with the prasad and found that both swamis were waiting for me anxiously. Swami Shuddhananda asked: “Well, Chandra, could you ask for liberation? What did the Mother say?” I told them what happened. I could not go to the Ganges that day and it took many hours to calm down.\nUnable to find a permanent solution to the financial problems of his family, Narendra(Swami Vivekananda) went to the Master one day and asked him to pray to the Divine Mother on his behalf, as Narendra had faith that She listened to the Master’s prayers. The Master told him to go to the temple and pray to Her himself for help, assuring him that his request would be granted. Narendra went to the temple with great anticipation. But as soon as he came before the image of the Divine Mother, he saw Her as living and conscious; he forgot the world and the pitiable condition of his mother, sisters, and brothers. In ecstatic joy he prostrated before Her and prayed: “Mother, give me discrimination! Give me renunciation! Give me knowledge and devotion! Grant that I may have an uninterrupted vision of Thee!” He went back to the Master and told him what had happened.The Master sent Narendra to the temple to pray again, but the same thing happened. The third time he remembered his intention, but he felt ashamed to ask for something so small from the Mother of the Universe. At last, at Narendra’s request, the Master blessed him, saying, “All right, your people at home will never be in want of plain food and clothing.”\nSri Ramakrishna Says —\n“But it is not possible for you to give up work altogether. Your very nature will lead you to it whether you like it or not. Therefore the scriptures ask you to work in a detached spirit, that is to say, not to crave the work’s results. (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\n—–\nNAVADVIP:\n“But how can we persuade our minds to renounce?”\nSri Ramakrishna:\n“You are a goswami. It is your duty to officiate as priest in the temple. You cannot renounce the world; otherwise, who would look after the temple and its services? You have to renounce mentally.\n“It is God Himself who has kept you in the world to set an example to men. You may resolve in your mind a thousand times to renounce the world, but you will not succeed. God has given you such a nature that you must perform your worldly duties.\n(\nBG 18.60\n)\n“Krishna said to Arjuna: ‘What do you mean, you will not fight? By your mere will you cannot desist from fighting. Your very nature will make you fight.'”\nAt the mere mention of Krishna and Arjuna the Master went into samadhi. In the twinkling of an eye his body became motionless and his eyeballs transfixed, while his breathing could scarcely be noticed. At this sudden transformation Navadvip and his son and the other devotees looked at the Master in mute wonder.\nRegaining partial consciousness, he said to Navadvip: “Yoga and bhoga. You goswamis have both. Now your only duty is to call on God and pray to Him sincerely: ‘O God, I don’t want the glories or Thy world-bewitching maya. I want Thee alone!’ God dwells in all beings, undoubtedly. That being the case, who may be called His devotee? He who dwells in God, he who has merged his mind and life and innermost soul in God.”\nThe Master returned to the sense plane. Referring to his samadhi, he said to Navadvip: “Some say that this state of mine is a disease. I say to them, “How can one become unconscious by thinking of Him whose Consciousness has made the whole world conscious?'”\n(Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\n—–\n“You know I am a fool. I know nothing. Then who is it that says all these things? I say to the Divine Mother: ‘O Mother, I am the machine and Thou art the Operator. I am the house and Thou art the Indweller. I am the chariot and Thou art the Charioteer. I do as Thou makest me do; I speak as Thou makest me speak; I move as Thou makest me move. It is not I! It is not I! It is all Thou! It is all Thou!’ Hers is the glory; we are only Her instruments. Once Radha, to prove her chastity, carried on her head a pitcher filled with water. The pitcher had a thousand holes, but not a, drop of water spilled. People began to praise her, saying, ‘Such a chaste woman tlie world will never see again!’ Then Radha said to them: ‘Why do you praise me? Say: “Glory unto Krishna! Hail Krishna!” I am only His handmaid.’\n“Once in that strange mood of mine I placed my foot on Vijay’s chest. You know how greatly I respect him — and I placed my foot on his body! What do you say to that?”\nDOCTOR:\n“But now you should be careful.”\nMASTER (\nwith folded hands\n):\n‘What can I do? I become completely unconscious in that mood. Then I do not know at all what I am doing.”\nDOCTOR:\n“You should be careful. No use folding your hands now and expressing regret!”\nMASTER:\n“Can I do anything\nmyself\nin that mood? What do you think of this state? If you think it is a hoax, then I should say that your study of ‘science’ and all that is bosh!”\nDOCTOR:\n“Now listen, sir! Would I come to see you so often if I thought it all a hoax? You know that I neglect many other duties in order to come here. I cannot visit many patients, for I spend six or seven hours at a stretch here.”\nMASTER:\n“Once I said to Mathur Babu: ‘Don’t think that I have achieved my desired end because you, a rich man, show me respect. It matters very little to me whether you obey me or not.’ Of course you must remember that a mere man can do nothing. It is God alone who makes one person obey another. Man is straw and dust before the power of God.”\nDOCTOR:\n“Do you think I shall obey you because a certain fisherman obeyed you? . . . Undoubtedly I show you respect; I show you respect as a man.”\nMASTER:\n“Do I ask you to show me respect?”\nGIRISH:\n“Does he ask you to show him respect?”\nDOCTOR (\nto the Master\n):\n“What are you saying? Do you explain it as the will of God?”\nMASTER:\n“What else can it be? What can a man do before the will of God? Arjuna said to Sri Krishna on the battle-field of Kurukshetra: ‘I will not fight. It is impossible for me to kill my own kinsmen.’ Sri Krishna replied: ‘Arjuna, you will have to. fight. Your very nature will make you fight.’ Then Sri Krishna revealed to Arjuna that all the men on the battle-field were already dead.\n“Once some Sikhs came to the Kali temple at Dakshineswar. They said: ‘You see, the leaves of the aswattha tree are moving. That too is due to the will of God.’ Without His will not even a leaf can move.” …….\n(\nTo the doctor\n) “Look here. If a man truly believes that God alone does everything, that He is the Operator and man the machine, then such a man is verily liberated in life. ‘Thou workest Thine own work; men only call it theirs.’ Do you know what it is like? Vedanta philosophy gives an illustration. Suppose you are cooking rice in a pot, with potato, egg-plant, and other vegetables. After a while the potatoes, egg-plant, rice, and the rest begin to jump about in the pot. They seem to say with pride: ‘We are moving! We are jumping!’ The children see it and think the potatoes, egg-plant, and rice are alive and so they jump that way. But the elders, who know, explain to the children that the vegetables and the rice are not alive; they jump not of themselves, but because of the fire under the pot; if you remove the burning wood from the hearth, then they will move no more. Likewise the pride of man, that he is the doer, springs from ignorance. Men are powerful because of the power of God. All becomes quiet when that burning wood is taken away. The puppets dance well on the stage when pulled by a wire, but they cannot move when the wire snaps.\n“A man will cherish the illusion that he is the doer as long as he has not seen God, as long as he has not touched the Philosopher’s Stone. So long will he know the distinction between his good and bad actions. This awareness of distinction is due to God’s maya; and it is necessary for the purpose of running His illusory world. But a man can realise God if he takes shelter under His vidyamaya and follows the path of righteousness. He who knows God and realises Him is able to go beyond maya. He who firmly believes that God alone is the Doer and he himself a mere instrument is a jivanmukta, a free soul though living in a body. I said this to Keshab Chandra Sen.”\n(Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\nRelated Articles:\nO Arjuna! bound by your own Karma, born of your own nature, that which in a deluded state you do not wish to do, even that you will do helplessly.

It is the most foolish delusion of man to think that the Lord is far away, somewhere in the remote sky, and at some such place where man cannot reach. This way of thinking has become a habit of mind for all mankind, except for a very few wise men, who know the secret. The Lord is not away from us. He is with us, in us right in our own heart. That is the Lord’s declaration. He dwells in the heart of all beings, and so one should be very careful in his thought and deeds. He sees all. He is the all-pervasive Atman. He is the dispenser of rewards and punishments for each and every being, according to his Punya and Papa Karma Therefore man should feel the presence of the Lord within and without and try his best to avoid evil and cling to the good only. People must follow the path of truth and righteousness, for, the Lord sees all by His invisible presence everywhere. The Lord’s declaration should inspire hope to the devotee. Where else is he to go to find the Lord who is present in his own heart?\nThe Lord is present everywhere, and most so in the heart of man. He should be worshipped as the nearest of the near and the dearest of the dear. Without any distinction whatsoever, he is in all beings. The vehicle of manifestation may be a small thing like an ant, or a big thing like an elephant. This does not make any difference at all for the Lord. He is equally present in all, in the sinner as well as in the saint.\nHis presence is felt more where the heart is pure. The difference is only in the degree of manifestation.\nIf the mirror is clear, the sun’s reflection is bright; if the mirror is unclear, the reflection is dim. This makes no difference at all to the Sun.",

    "commentary": "It is said in the previous verse that man is bound to the wheel of Samsara by the power of Maya. What is the way to liberation? How can he attain supreme peace? The answer is given in this verse. To surrender with all his being, whole-heartedly to the Lord who dwells in all beings is the only way to attain freedom from the shackles of Samsara. If anybody wants to stop a machine he must seek the help of the mechanic. The Lord is the mechanic who holds and runs the tremendous machine of Samsara. Therefore Jiva has to take refuge in the Lord if he wants liberation. Without whole-hearted surrender to the Lord, the power of Maya will not give way. Only the power of the Lord is capable of terminating the power of Maya. To none else will Maya give way. Therefore the Lord advises Arjuna to surrender to Him with all his being. This exhortation is for all beings. It is the simplest and easiest path for everyone to follow.\nAll physical powers are subject to the power of Maya and Maya is subject to the power of the Lord. Knowing this, man has to give up pride and egoism and take refuge in the Lord with humility and devotion.\nThe same idea is expressed many times in many places in the Gita. This is one of the central ideas of the Scripture. That the idea of surrender is emphasised in the last verses of the scripture is sufficient proof that it is the major current of thought throughout. Arjuna surrendered to the Lord before the message of Gita is offered to him. The idea is once again brought into a focal point at the end.\nSarvabha-vena:\nWith all his being (i.e.) body, mind and speech. It means that surrender should be complete and unconditional. The whole responsibility is given over to the Lord. The difficulty for the common man is that his surrender generally is conditioned by a secret and silent demand. It is not unreserved. Man’s faith is generally half-hearted. He doubts the mercy of the Lord. He partly wishes to do things by himself, although his life’s experience shows that he has not obtained any great advantage by his own effort. After many many births, man realises that the will of the Lord is supreme, and it is He who is a trustworthy friend and supporter for him in this life, here and now. The sooner man discovers it the better it is for him, for he will then obtain the peace which has been eluding him.\nTat prasadat:\nBy the grace of the Lord. Divine Grace! He who has obtained it, unto him everything is possible. All crookedness shall be straightened for him by the Lord’s grace. He becomes a Dharmatma quickly, says the Lord. How can one obtain God’s Grace? By surrender, with a pure and clear heart, without any reservations, personal ambitions and plans for getting this or that material benefit. What does not man obtain by such surrender? Peace, bliss and liberation from the wheel of Samsara. All the highest aspirations of man are fulfilled by the Lord’s grace.\nParam santim\n: Supreme Peace. The state of Moksha is the highest peace and bliss. It is peace that passeth understanding. It does not depend upon external circumstances. Kings cannot have it. Even emperors cannot hold that peace. It is not any of the different worlds. This peace is in the Atman, who is the real Seer behind all this phenomenal world.\nThe phenomenal world is only an appearance, and attachment to the false, inert and sorrowful would destroy all happiness within. He who disassociates himself from this load of matter, and takes shelter within the Lord finds the treasure of true happiness and peace.",

    "translation": "Thus, I have explained to you this knowledge that is more secret than all secrets. Ponder over it deeply, and then do as you wish.",
    "commentary": "The Lord describes the Gita-Sastra as the most secret of all knowledge. The teachings of this wisdom should be communicated only to such disciples who are qualified to receive it. Arjuna was qualified to receive it by virtue of his great devotion to Krishna, and the virtuous qualities (Daivisampat) that he possessed. Lord Krishna has thereby done a great service to mankind. Even for learning any worldly skill or art, a great deal of preparation is necessary for the student. When that is so, what amount of internal and external preparation is necessary for receiving this highest wisdom, one can easily understand. So the Lord declares that he has taught the most secret wisdom to Arjuna, just because he is fit to receive it, and finds it most necessary in the circumstances in which he is placed.\nVimrisyaita daseshena:\nFully reflecting over it. It is the practice of all great teachers to give all that the disciple wants by way of teaching and instruction, and finally leave it to the disciple to decide what he should do, and how he should act. Only the narrow-minded teacher insists on the disciple to accept what he says without doubt or question. On the other hand, the great teachers give complete freedom of thought and reflection to the disciples. Man has to make a free choice of his course of action according to his own nature. The disciple should Know and feel the truth of what was taught to him. Then only he derives the full benefit of the master’s teaching. We see in this context how broad-minded the Lord was when he left the freedom of choice to Arjuna himself. Arjuna was one of the greatest devotees of Krishna. Krishna’s word was law unto him. If Lord Krishna wanted Arjuna to fight in the form of a command, Arjuna would have immediately acted up without any hesitation. But the Lord takes a different view. After giving the full message of wisdom, the Lord asks Arjuna to reflect over it, think well and deeply, and come to a voluntary decision. Such a decision would ultimately benefit him much more than a mere verbal command from the teacher. The final decision is left entirely to the individual.\nYadhecchasi tadha Kuru:\nAct as you wish. The Lord simply explained the position to Arjuna. That is all. He has nothing more to say. The disciple is free to take it or leave it. Here is a great example of Nishkama-karma. Having taught the Gita Sastra, the Lord leaves it without a thought of the fruit of his action. Although the main objective of the Lord is to make Arjuna fight the battle, He remains unconcerned about the result of his message. The Lord seems to say “you may fight or you may not. That is your decision, not mine. I have taught you the essence of all the Vedas, and it is your duty in the present situation, to take it or leave it. I am unconcerned”. Such is the way how great teachers act in respect of their disciples. Their message is delivered in a simple and powerful way. They pass on, leaving it to the people to think about it, draw their own conclusions and come to their own decision. This is an example of Nishkama-karma with which the scripture comes to a close.\nJnanam akhyyatam:\nAlthough in the Gita Sastra, the Lord has dealt with Karma, Bhakti, Dhyana, etc., they are all implied in the simple word wisdom (Jnana). The various paths culminate in Jnana. They are all intended to purify the mind gradually, and the mind so purified by the practice of Karma and Bhakti etc., acquires Jnana by which man attains the highest goal of Moksha. Karma and Bhakti are stepping stones to Jnana. Jnana is the peak point of realisation.\nSwami Vivekananda Says —\nMy idea is to bring to the door of the meanest, the poorest, the noble ideas that the human race has developed both in and out of India, and let them think for themselves.\n[Source]\nLiberty is the first condition of growth. It is wrong, a thousand times wrong, if any of you dares to say, “I will work out the salvation of this woman or child.” I am asked again and again, what I think of the widow problem and what I think of the woman question. Let me answer once for all — am I a widow that you ask me that nonsense? Am I a woman that you ask me that question again and again? Who are you to solve women’s problems? Are you the Lord God that you should rule over every widow and every woman? Hands off! They will solve their own problems.\n[Source]\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda",

    "commentary": "This verse and the next one contain the essence of the Gita teaching. The Lord has already declared that he is now revealing the most profound secret out of love for his disciple.\nIn this verse and the next, the first part states the path of spiritual progress, and the last part declares the goal of spiritual life. Four types of spiritual discipline are pointed out here (1) Fixing the mind on God, (2) Devotion to God, (3) Performing sacrifice unto God. (4) Humble prostration to God. Such discipline leads to the highest realisation, namely, union with God.\nTherefore those who seek knowledge should reject all the temptations of the flesh. They should fix their mind on God and love God with the same zeal and attraction as they feel for the objects of the senses. They should bow to God in utter humility. They should meditate on God with a full heart. The ignorant unfortunately run after sensual pleasures and distract their minds with a hundred petty desires and longings. They miss the way and are lost in darkness. They have strayed away from the path of true happiness. They cannot realise the bliss of union with God.\nSattyam te pratijane:\nThe Lord clears the last trace of doubt from the mind of Arjuna by saying- “This is the truth; I pledge my word.” Rarely do we come across such open declarations from the Lord in the course of his teaching. One’s faith in the Lord’s teaching is doubled and redoubled, and he accepts the final words of the Lord with deep and unswerving faith, and attains liberation.\nManmanah bhava:\nAll the four paths of spiritual progress are included in this verse (1) Action (Karma), (2) Devotion (Bhakti), (3) Meditation (Dhyana) (4) Knowledge (Jnana).\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda",

    "commentary": "The Lord teaches his disciple that this great science of Liberation should not be revealed to those who are devoid of austerity and devotion.\nThis warning is necessary and no true seeker is excluded from the benefit of receiving the light of knowledge. It means that the seeker for Liberation should make himself fit to receive this knowledge by austerity, service and devotion.\nIt should not be taught to people who have neither self-control nor devotion to God. Such men are likely to disparage this great and secret knowledge and give false interpretation to the laws enunciated in the Gita. In practical life one comes across many flippant shallow people, engrossed in worldliness, who decry all spiritual knowledge as a foolish exercise in futility. Such men do great harm to society. They destroy faith and create doubts about the truth of this great science. Such men are not only unhelpful but positively harmful to society.\nThe idea is stated negatively, but its positive meaning is clear. The receiver of this knowledge should possess certain qualities of character. He must have acquired self-discipline by following an austere way of life. He must possess devotion. He must have served elders and teachers, and he should never scorn the wise masters, who deliver this wonderful message.\nAbove all, the disciple should be most eager to free himself from the ills of the flesh. This eagerness, this yearning to know the truth, to live by it, and experience the bliss of Liberation. in his own life, is the first qualification for receiving the message of the Gita.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda\nSwami Turiyananda: “If the Lord is ever present inside and outside, then with what object should you undergo austerities? And if He be not inside and outside, of what avail are these austerities ?’ In other words, we must go through them, betaking ourselves to God. In our country, however, there is now a sad dearth of austerities. One no more hears nowadays of rigid austerities as of old. Well, this is the result of undigested Vedanta.\nIs it possible to understand the truths of Vedanta without undergoing austerities?\nVicharasâgara\nis a misnomer now. Pseudo-Vedantism has spoilt the country. They simply talk big-‘He only exists, “The universe is non-existent, in the past, present, as well as in the future,’ and so on. Nonsense! Do they mean anything by all that?\nVedanta cannot be understood except through austerities.\n” (Source: Spiritual Talks by the First Disciples of Sri Ramakrishna)\n[\nVicharasâgara\n: A celebrated Hindi metrical treatise on Advaita Vedanta by Nischaladása, extensively read by up-country Sadhus, many of whom make a travesty of its teachings in their everyday life.]\nSwami Turiyananda: “Only the One exists, nothing else. We see Him as men, animals, birds, insects, plants etc. If we only think correctly, we shall find that there is no such differentiation in Him. How we imagine an ego and slave for its gratification! Each has his own world which accompanies him beyond death. It is enjoyment and the desire for it that obstruct true knowledge; freed from them we can have knowledge this moment. Are we not knowledge itself? But alas, it is so hard to renounce the joys of the world!\n“Unless we are willing to understand, none can convince us. There was a king who promised the gift of half his kingdom to anyone who would teach him the preparation of puffed rice. Many came and explained and demonstrated, but at the end the king would always say that he did not understand. How could he? He simply would not! We are also like him. Who does not know that the world is transitory ? But we refuse to feel convinced lest we also have to give away ‘half the kingdom’ – the enjoyments of the world.” (Source: Spiritual Talks by the First Disciples of Sri Ramakrishna)",

    "commentary": "On many occasions, the Lord has warned the devotee against the evils of malice and hatred, and once again he emphasises the idea at the end of his teaching Besides being free from these twin evils, one should possess single-minded devotion and faith (Sraddha). Without faith (Sraddha) no one can achieve anything great in any sphere of life. And particularly in the spiritual realm, no man can achieve any merit if his heart is impure. Malice is like a canker. It eats away the vital forces of man and renders him weak and disabled for any great purusuit.\nThere may be many illiterate persons who are eager to learn and know the Sastras, and who feel disappointed by their inability to read the sacred books. The Lord here declares that they need not at all be disappointed. They may hear the Gita-Sastra and acquire spiritual merit which offers them the reward of attaining the happy worlds of the righteous.\nOnly the condition is that their hearts should be pure, free from malice and hatred. The center of spiritual knowledge is the heart and not the brain. It is the illumination of the heart that liberates man. The Lord abides in the lotus of the heart.\nOne comes across learned scholars who have thoroughly read the Sastras, but who still remain ignorant of the highest wisdom. This goes to show that their hearts are still dim and obscure in spite of their vast learning. People honour them for their learning, but the light of true knowledge they cannot give because their hearts are troubled by the tempest of Samsara.\nOn the other hand, there are illiterate people whose hearts are pure and untainted. They are fit to be initiated into the secrets of true knowledge. The Lord advises such pure souls to hear the Gita, and thus acquire spiritual merit.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda",

    "commentary": "As a physician who at the end of his treatment asks the sick man if his illness is cured, so also the Lord questions Arjuna whether His teaching has removed the delusion of ignorance. Ignorance of one’s own real nature is the disease from which all mankind suffers. Ignorance creates delusion, and man forgets his real nature. The wise man who knows his real nature, who feels that he is not the body, but the glorious Atma, frees himself from all suffering and sorrow.\nEkagrena chetasa:\n(One-pointed mind)-Concentration is essential in every type of work. A divided and distracted mind cannot achieve anything good and useful. The mind acquires power by concentration. If the waters of a lake are disturbed, there cannot be a clear reflection of surrounding trees. A mirror cannot reflect a moving face correctly and clearly. So also, if the mind is unsteady and disturbed, there cannot be a clear reflection of the Reality (Atma). Therefore the Lord questions Arjuna whether he has heard the Gita-teaching with a concentrated mind. One should study the Gita with a concentrated mind. Only then does he understand its meaning clearly. This is no doubt an elementary principle in the study and understanding of any subject. More so, in the study of the Gita which contains the highest spiritual truth. The student has to be extremely alert and concentrated in mind.\nAjnana sammohah:\n(The delusion of ignorance)-Delusion is the effect of ignorance. A man sees a rope and mistakes it for a snake. This is delusion. Here delusion clouded Arjuna’s mind as he saw his relations and friends who stood opposed to him on the battlefield. The Lord’s teaching cleared the delusion.",

Arjuna is the wielder of the bow, Gandiva. He is not only a hero on the battlefield of Kurukshetra. but he is also a devotee who conquered the inner enemies of delusion and ignorance. The knowledge of the Gita is like Gandiva in the hands of Arjuna. Knowledge, devotion and action are the mighty weapons in his battle with ignorance. Victory is thus assured for the true devotee.",
