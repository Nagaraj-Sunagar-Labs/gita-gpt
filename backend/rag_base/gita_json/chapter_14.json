    "commentary": "Mama sadharmyam agatah:\nThe unparalleled excellence of jnana is declared most wonderfully here. The sages, possessing this knowledge, became one with God Himself. They assume the state of God. What else can man aspire for? “\nJnani tu atmaiva me matam\n” (7.18). The man of knowledge is God Himself. The devotee becomes the Deity. Such union with the Lord is the effect of this wisdom. The wise man of supreme knowledge is God in essence. There cannot be two Infinites, two Gods. If man cuts off his limiting adjuncts, he becomes the Infinite, the Immortal. It is needless to assert that the man who is seeking such union with the Lord is discharging the highest and noblest of his duties as a human being!\nThe union with the Lord liberates the sage from birth and death. He becomes ‘ajah’, ‘nityah’. There is no ‘return’ for him. Even at the time of creation, he is not born, nor does he perish at the time of dissolution. The cycle of birth and death (‘punarapi jananam punarapi maranam’) stops for ever. He becomes one with the Absolute Sachidhananda. Therefore the only way to free oneself from the ills of samsara is to attain Brahma-Jnana.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda",

    "commentary": "The three Gunas, Sattva, Rajas and Tamas are born of prakriti. Atma is free from them. Atma is Nirguna, devoid of these qualities. It transcends them. Even so, the individual man having forgotten his Atma and its transcendental nature, associates himself with the Gunas, identifies himself with them, and binds himself to the inert perishable body. Thus the Imperishable ever-fee Atma is lost by the jiva who becomes an embodied being subject to all the ills of life and death. This mistaken identity is (avidya) ignorance. Man has to release himself from every one of these gunas, and rise to the Atmic plane which is free and perfect. The Sattva Guna which is free is also mentioned as one of the bonds, because it is only in the Nirvikalpa Samadhi that man goes beyond all the gunas and realises Paramatma. In that state, there are no qualities or states or thoughts. As the aspirant rises higher and higher, he finds that Sattva guna also is like a screen (a thin screen but yet a screen) between him and the ultimate.\nThe seekers must have a longing to march. Tamas has to be conqureed by Rajas; and Rajas has to be purified by Sattva and Sattva has to be discarded at the end to reach Atma. That is Moksha.",

    "translation": "Of these, sattva, being stainless, is luminous and healthful. It binds, Ο sinless Arjuna, by creating attachment to happiness and attachment to knowledge.",
    "commentary": "As the three Gunas are produced from prakriti, Sattva guna also is a part of ‘avidya’. But it is the pure aspect of Prakriti. By its purity, it is superior of higher than the other two gunas. So it is no doubt a desirable quality in spiritual progress. But in the perfect Atmic state, even this Sattva guna pure and light-giving as it is, is an obstacle, a covering veil to Atma. If a pure light is covered by glasses of three colours, different effects are produced. If the glass is dark, the light is dim. If the glass is red, the light casts a red shadow. If the glass is white the light is clear. But the white glass also is a covering veil to the pure light within. The original purity of the light itself is modified by the glass, however clean it might be. So also the sattva guna binds the jiva by attachment to happiness and knowledge. When a man says ‘I am happy’, he is attributing to himself the experience of the senses and the mind (Kshetra) to himself. The false identification is due to ‘avidya’. This happiness is kshetradharma, and it is superimposed on the Kshetrajna (Atma) by the ignorance of the Jiva. And again, when a person says ‘I have knowledge of this or that’, he is committing the same error in imposing on Atma, the quality of the intellect which is also Kshetradharma. Thus Sattva guna binds man to happiness and knowledge. Both are modifications of the mind and intellect. They do not belong to Atma. So the Lord exhorts Arjuna to transcend the Sattva guna also and reach the Atmic state.",

    "commentary": "The word ‘Trishna’ means passion for objects not possessed by him. ‘Sanga’ means attachment for those things already possessed by him. Rajoguna causes both passion and attachment. The effect of this passion is activity to gain this or that object, wealth, name and fame, power and position etc. The mad rush that one sees in the world is all the manifestation of Rajoguna. Territories are gained, wars are fought, enemies are put down, name is achieved, fame is obtained and thus in a hundred ways, man works for selfish ends and aims; This is Rajoguna. Thus action is the outer manifestation of Rajoguna. The Rajasic man cannot remain quiet. He is urged into action by the very force of Rajas. Action binds him. In this also, there is the false imposition of Kshetradharma on the pure and perfect Atma. The Lord uses a very strong word ‘nibadhnati’, not simply ‘badhnati’ when he speaks of the binding power of Rajoguna and tamoguna.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda",

    "commentary": "Tamoguna is the direct effect of ignorance. It deludes man and throws him down into the dark prison-house of samsara. The state of the Jiva under its influence is like the sun being covered up by thick dark clouds, or like a light covered up by dark smoke-stained glass. Its deluding power is universally felt, by all, except the Jivanmuktas. That is why the word Sarvadehinam is used. Even the most intelligent are sometimes blind to the realities of a situation. They err, fall into lethargy, and forget themselves in beastly sleep. The common run of mankind is directly under its power. Sleep, idleness, incapacity, inefficiency, neglect of duty, shirking of work, all these are Tamoguna qualities. Each individual can easily find out for himself what his nature is. If he is negligent, idle and sleepy, it is a sure sign that Tamas predominates in his nature.\nIt is to be understood that no man is dominated only by one Guna. The three Gunas attending express themselves in the mind, at one stage or other. When Tamas dominates, he sleeps, when Rajas dominates he acts, and when Sattva comes up, he is calm and enjoys the bliss of power.\nThe seekers should first of all free themselves from Tamas and Rajas. These qualities bind man and fling him into the mire of samsara. By understanding the nature of these qualities, man should rise above them slowly and gradually.",

    "commentary": "This verse is just a summary of the above three verses. The three Gunas and their main qualities are restated for easy understanding. Sattva guna leads man to knowledge and happiness of a worldly nature; Rajoguna prompts man to worldly action prompted by selfishness and Tamoguna leads to wrong understanding, sleeep and laziness. Sattvaguna is like the covering of a pure glass over the light, Rajoguna is like the covering of cane-basket over the light; and Tamoguna is like the covering of a pot over the light. In the first instance, light comes out through the glass, the medium being quite pure. In the second instance, some rays of light escape through the chinks of the basket. But in the third instance, the pot being opaque, the light within is totally covered. The state of Tamas is utter darkness. The man in darkness stumbles and falls, mistakes objects, takes one thing to be another, and thus commits a number of mistakes.\nThe pure light of Atma, a blissful and ever blessed, is thus shrouded by the three Gunas. Man is bound by them.

When Sattvaguna functions, the other two gunas are over-powered. So also when Rajoguna functions, the other two are suppressed; when Tamoguna is powerful the other two gunas are overpowered. Therefore the seekers have to strengthen Sattvaguna and by its power suppress the other two Gunas. That is the first thing to be done in spiritual practice. Rajas and Tamas should be eliminated and it can be done only by nourishing Sattvaguna at all times. If Sattva dominates the seeker has ascended to a very high plane, and from there, it would not be far away to rise above it in the realisation of God.\nSwami Vivekananda Says —\nWith the prevalence of the sattvika essence, man becomes inactive and rests always in a state of deep dhyana or contemplation; with the prevalence of the rajas, he does bad as well as good works; and with the prevalence of the tamas again, he becomes inactive and inert. Now, tell me, looking from outside, how are we to understand, whether you are in a state wherein the sattva or the tamas prevails? Whether we are in a state of sattvika calmness, beyond all pleasure and pain, and past all work and activity, or whether we are in the lowest tamasika state, lifeless, passive, dull as dead matter, and doing no work, because there is no power in us to do it, and are, thus, silently and by degrees, getting rotten and corrupted within — I seriously ask you this question and demand an answer. Ask your own mind, and you shall know what the reality is.\n[Source]\nSattva binds through the search for happiness and knowledge, rajas binds through desire, tamas binds through wrong perception and laziness.

When Sattva dominates, his speech is soft and pleasing. He walks steadily, he thinks nobly and peacefully, he eats pure food, he reads good books, he keeps the company of the wise. This truth is declared in this verse. We can easily identify the man of Sattva-guna and in the same way we can identify the people of Rajo-guna and Tamo-guna by their activities. Sattva is light and knowledge. The intellect (Buddhi) is then sharp and clear. He sees things as they are, and is not perturbed or troubled by the happenings around him. Such balanced conduct is the quality of Sattva. In fact, the external life of a man is itself the measuring metre to find out what his nature is. With some degree of introspection and self-examination, it is quite possible for each one to find out where he stands in the scale of the Gunas. He should proceed from Tamas to Rajas and from Rajas to Sattva and from Sattva to visuddha Sattva and thence to the transcendental state of Self-realisation.\nBhagavad Gita 14.11 to 14.13 Swami Chetanananda",

Greed and longing urge him to undertake many actions for the fulfillment of his desires. These desires are sometimes selfish and prohibited by the Sastras. Longing for objects drives him into acts of evil and sin. He employs tricks and stratagems to realise his ambitions. He has no regard for truth. His mind is externalised. He has no introspection. He is like the ocean troubled by a tempest. His words are harsh and proud. He walks unsteadily because of his mental restlessness. His mind is full of desire for this and that. So he lives a life of passion, and does not know what is peace and real joy. Ravana is an example of Rajoguna. Rajo-guna, therefore, leads to evil and self-destruction. It should be overcome by perseverance and firm effort. Peace and joy cannot be found in Rajo-guna.\nOn 13 July 1885, the Master (Sri Ramakrishna) went to attend the Chariot Festival at Balaram’s house in Calcutta.

    "commentary": "The predominating quality of Tamas is darkness (i.e) absence of reason and true understanding. Inertness, disinclination towards activity of any kind, delusion and erroneous thoughts and opinions about things, all these arise from Tamo-guna. The man whose nature is dominated – by this guna can be discovered by what be eats, what he speaks, and by his general behaviour. The sourness of an unripe mango is a suitable comparison for Tamo-guna. Kumbhakarna is an example of Tamo-guna. It is quite possible for each individual to understand his own nature, whether it is Sattvic or Rajasic or Tamasic. It has already been pointed out that these qualities function in an endless cycle. The same man is Sattivic some times, Rajasic some times and Tamasic some times. When the Sattvic spell comes, to recognise it and confirm it in one’s nature is the way to eliminate the other two qualities gradually. Nothing can be done in a day. Perseverance will ultimately conquer all obstacles. So, the seekers have to be vigilant, and when the darker quality tries to dominate him, he should overcome it with all the strength and force of his will-power. The tree should be watered at the roots; If this is done, the unripe fruits become gradually ripe, their sourness is turned into sweetness, and they drop off from the tree of their own accord. The aim is to transcend the three Gunas and reach Atma. Devotion to the Lord, prayer meditation and good work, – all these are essential factors in Sadhana. By these, the Tamasic and Rajasic tendencies are eliminated from the mind. Sattva is purity. This state is very near to Atma, And so to come up to the plane of Sattva is the first necessary step. And later, the aspirant has to go beyond it also, and become a Jivanmukta by Self-realisation.",

    "translation": "If the embodied soul meets with death when sattva prevails, it goes to the spotless realms of those who know the Highest.",
    "commentary": "It is declared that the future birth of man is determined by the Guna that dominates in him at the time of death. If Sattva-guna predominates, then the Jiva attains the pure worlds which the wise go to. Sattva-guna is the effect of long practice in self-perfection. Tamas and Rajas have to be eliminated by Nishkama Karma, by devotion and by studious understanding of the Truth. If a man cultivates Sattva-guna through a long life-time of steady practice, then, even at the time of death, his mind remains pure, calm, and full of peace. Leaving the body in that state is good, because it takes him to higher worlds of purity and knowledge. So the seekers have to be vigilant and cautious and observe how they are progressing on the path of self-purification. They should remember that their future life in other worlds will be strictly determined by their state of mind in this life. They should refrain from any evil and sinful acts because they are caused by impure Rajas and Tamas. Otherwise, they shall have to suffer in low worlds of a painful nature.",

Thus continuously, birth after birth, urged by his own selfish desires and passions, he leads a restless and agitated life. He is bound to the wheel of karma.\nThe Tamasic man is born in the wombs of the senseless birds, beasts and reptiles and so on. What horrible punishment it is to be born as a wolf or a jackal or a snake etc.? What rational man is there who does not shudder at this horrible prospect of his future life? Is there any man who would willingly be born in the wombs of the wretched and the ignorant? No. Every man wants to go up, and not fall down. Human nature aspires for higher and higher things. So let the aspirants beware of the horrible consequences of their future life. If they fail to heed the warnings of the Lord, Sri Krishna Paramatma they have to suffer. The Lord is revealing the future in the present. Having eyes one should see. Having ears one should hear. Having reason, one should understand. Devotion, dispassion, and knowledge (Bhakti, Vairagya and Jnana), one needs to save himself from future misery and wretchedness.",

    "commentary": "Every man wants happiness and not suffering. But he should do only those actions from which peace and joy arise. His actions should be pure, beneficent, and selfless. Then he enjoys peace and joy which is the fruit of Sattva-guna. Suffering and ignorance arise from Rajo-guna and Tamo-guna. So the wise man should avoid all actions of a Rajasic nature, because they verily produce suffering. Knowing this, no thoughtful man would willingly do wrong things in anger and passion. Knowing that fire burns, who would thrust his hand into it? No one. So also, one should clearly perceive that the terrible effects of Rajas – Kama and Krodha (Rajo guna samudbhavah) are very dangerous. Through them, man is passing through hell even in this world. He suffers from pain, restlessness, horrid dreams, fears, deluding hopes, disappointments, despair, desperation and despondency. Such is Rajo-guna.\nAnd now when we come to Tamoguna, it is all darkness and ignorance. Under its power man lives like an animal. He eats, sleeps, and copulates. He has no idea of anything pure and holy. He lives an animal life. Nay, he is worse than animals. Being born as man and yet live the life of animals is against one’s own humanity. The human form then counts for nothing. The saint and the sinner are both clad in the human garb. But there is the difference of pole to pole between the two. Tamas is the enemy of most men. It should be overcome in every way possible.\nRajasastu phalam duhkham:\nLet this declaration of the Lord be kept in view by every seeker, whatever he thinks and acts. If one wants peace and joy, Rajas should be given up. There is no other way.\nAjnanam tamasah phalam:\nIgnorance is the seed-bed of all other evils. Rajas arises from Tamas. Knowledge removes both Tamas and Rajas. Knowledge pure and perfect! That should be our goal. Tamas should be given up as enemy number one for all mankind.",

    "translation": "When a man of insight beholds no agent other than the gunas, and also knows Him who is beyond the gunas, he attains My being.",
    "commentary": "This verse and the next are very important. The seekers who are enquiring into Truth should understand the idea and keep it always in their mind. It is the direct path to Brahma jnana (Moksha), liberation from the bondage of samsara. Whatever actions are performed by man, the agent invariably, is the Gunas (i.e), the mind which is composed of the three Gunas. Except the three Gunas there is no other thing as the mind. The mind through the agency of the senses and the body, causes all actions. The senses and the body, are instruments. The mind is the directing agent. What is bound is the mind; and what attains liberation is the mind. There is no other agent or enjoyer. Atma is distinct from this mind.\nTherefore, the seeker has to understand that he is entirely distinct and separate from the three Gunas, that he is Atma, and hence that he is not at all the agent (karta) or enjoyer (bhokta). When this distinction is clearly seen, man remains as the seer (Drik). He realises Atma. So the first step towards liberation is to know that the real man is the seer (neither Karta nor Bhokta). O Jiva! do not get mixed up with the three Gunas, which constitute the mind; keep aloof from them; see what they do; but never get confused with them; they are not you; you are distinct from and separate from them. You are in truth, Atma. This is Lord’s compassionate teaching.\nIn the spectacular drama of the universe, the real actor is the mind, the three gunas. And the Atma, like the lighting in the theatre, is shedding its light on all, while remaining unattached to anything that is taking place on the stage. He is like the screen of the theatre on which the picture is projected. The picture is constantly changing and displaying various colours, characters and actions. The screen is not affected by the picture, whether it is a tragedy or a farce or anything else. Even so, the Atma stands really unattached and unaffected by the wailings and laughters of the mind, by the functions of the senses, and by the activities of the body. This is the highest Truth. All that is considered happiness or sorrow is only the modifications of the three gunas. Out of delusion, the Jiva identifies himself with the gunas, and attributes to himself what is Deha dharma and Mano-dharma. He says, ‘I am born; I am sick or healthy; I die; I am old or young;’ Thus he is clearly identifying himself with the body. He says again, “I am happy; I am sad; 1 am angry; I am calm; I am dull or I am bright.” Thus he is identifying himself with the mind and its changes. That is bondage. This idea of false identification is what is called ‘avidya’. The moment when the falsehood is found out, that very moment the Jiva knows that he is Atma, and there is no more a ‘Karta’ or a ‘Bhokta’ to be bound to the world. All bondage is shattered at one stroke.\nMadbhavam so adhigacchati:\nKnowing that the gunas are the cause of all actions and knowing that he is the ‘drashta’ the Jiva becomes Siva, the nara (man) becomes Narayana, the Jana (man) becomes Janardana. So from this very moment onwards, the seeker should give up all foolish notions that he is this or that, and firmly fix himself in the state of Paramatma, beyond all the modifications of the body and the mind.\nAdhi gacchati:\nThe Lord declares that man attains God by this discrimination. Let the aspirants have faith in the Lord’s words, drive away all weakness and cowardice and attain the highest.",

In other words, he is indifferent whether the Gunas are existing or not. They may function or they may cease to function; he is not at all concerned.

Little disappointments, worries, anxieties, throw him off the balance. He becomes restless, discontented, and dispirited by any kind of adversity. The Gunatita is exactly the opposite type. He is imperturbable, undaunted by anything that may happen. The waves may dash against the mountain endlessly, but the mountain remains immovable. So, difficulties and dangers may come to the Gunatita but he remains immovable. Is the sun in any way troubled by the storms and tempests, the thunders and lightning that occur under him? So is the Gunatita. He is above these storms and tempests, resting firmly in Atma. He does not move away from Atma. He knows full well that whatever happens in the world is only a mental phenomenon with which he has no contact whatsoever. Such a man is the very embodiment of courage and boldness. It is not the bravado of the ordinary mortals, but the courage that comes from Brahma Jnana. This is the first and the greatest mark of the Gunatita.

Towards friends and enemies, in pleasure and pain, honour and dishonour, censure and praise, toward worthless and valuable things like stone or gold, he is equal-minded. Suka, when he visited the Court of Janaka, was put to severe test by the latter. He was made to stay without food for some days, he was not even recognised for some days, he was provided the highest luxuries for some days, – in these ways, his equanimity was tested by the King. Suka stood the test, because he was a perfect Jnani, a Gunatita. Such great sages have their life and being in Atma and so they do not recognise the objective world and react to it in the way that common people do.

    "translation": "The blessed Lord said: O Arjuna! He (the Gunatita) does not hate when the three Gunas bring happiness (from Sattva), action (from Rajo-guna), and delusion (from Tamo-guna): nor does he long for them when they are absent.\nHe sits like one unconcerned, unaffected by the Gunas, knowing that the Gunas are functioning, and is not moved.\nHe is equal-minded in joy and sorrow, established in Self; regards a clod, a stone, and gold alike; the same in pleasant and unpleasant things; heroic, equal in censure and praise.\nHe is the same in honour and dishonour; the same towards friends and enemies; abadons all actions; he is said to be Gunatita.",
    "commentary": "In the 22nd verse, it is declared that the Gunatita is indifferent to the functioning of three qualities. Sattva may bring happiness; Rajas may bring action; Tamas may cause delusion. When these effects are produced, he does not hate them. Nor does he long for them, when they are absent. In other words, he is indifferent whether the Gunas are existing or not. They may function or they may cease to function; he is not at all concerned. He does not hate them when they function, nor does he long for them when they cease to function.\nThe effects of the three Gunas are mentioned here to lend force to the idea that the Gunatita is above the Gunas, and so their functioning or non-functioning is no concern for him. We have to understand that the Gunatita would not be subject to the power of the Gunas like the common people. Otherwise, he would not be a Gunatita. The point is that one should be regardless of these qualities, and their functions, having established himself in the Self. Whether it is the knowledge of Sattva, or the activity of Rajas, or the delusion of Tamas, he (the Gunatita) neither hates nor longs for them. He has nothing to do with them at all.\nThe permanent characters of the Gunatita strike our attention. 1. Immovable firmness (\nNischalatvam\n), 2. Equal-mindedness (\nsamatvam\n).\n(1) The difference between the Yogi and the common man is seen in critical moments. Small things perturb the common man. Little disappointments, worries, anxieties, throw him off the balance. He becomes restless, discontented, and dispirited by any kind of adversity. The Gunatita is exactly the opposite type. He is imperturbable, undaunted by anything that may happen. The waves may dash against the mountain endlessly, but the mountain remains immovable. So, difficulties and dangers may come to the Gunatita but he remains immovable. Is the sun in any way troubled by the storms and tempests, the thunders and lightning that occur under him? So is the Gunatita. He is above these storms and tempests, resting firmly in Atma. He does not move away from Atma. He knows full well that whatever happens in the world is only a mental phenomenon with which he has no contact whatsoever. Such a man is the very embodiment of courage and boldness. It is not the bravado of the ordinary mortals, but the courage that comes from Brahma Jnana. This is the first and the greatest mark of the Gunatita. The Gunatita is in this sense a Sthithaprajna.\n(2). Equal-mindedness is the next distinguishing quality of the Gunatita. Towards friends and enemies, in pleasure and pain, honour and dishonour, censure and praise, toward worthless and valuable things like stone or gold, he is equal-minded. Suka, when he visited the Court of Janaka, was put to severe test by the latter. He was made to stay without food for some days, he was not even recognised for some days, he was provided the highest luxuries for some days, – in these ways, his equanimity was tested by the King. Suka stood the test, because he was a perfect Jnani, a Gunatita. Such great sages have their life and being in Atma and so they do not recognise the objective world and react to it in the way that common people do. To them, the objective world and all that is occurring in it, is merely a grand show without any reality in it. They are only reflected images of the mind.

    "translation": "And he who worships Me with the yoga of undeviating love rises above the gunas and becomes fit to be one with Brahman.",
    "commentary": "Paramatma is beyond the three Gunas. To go beyond them is the way to become Brahman. But how to cross over the Gunas? A great deal of enquiry, self-control, meditation is necessary for it. But here, the Lord declares that self-realisation is possible for one who is devoted to Him with single-minded devotion (Bhakti). Bhakti helps the devotee to transcend the Gunas. It is to be noted that in every Discourse, whatever may be the yoga taught in it, the Lord emphasises Bhakti as the universal element in all kinds of practices. In this Discourse in which pure knowledge is taught, the Lord introduces the idea of Bhakti and the need for devotion at the end.\nWhether man takes to Karma Yoga, Jnana Yoga or Dhyana Yoga, he should cultivate Bhakti, devotion to the Lord. This devotion is the life-force for all yogas. Without it, no spiritual progress is possible.\nBhakti of the lower type is not enough. It should be ‘\navyabhicharini\n‘ (i.e.) undivided, not attached to anything else except the Supreme Lord. Pure Bhakti requires the highest renunciation. The mind should be centred in the Lord totally and completely. The world has no place in the mind of the true devotee. The Lord only and nothing else that is the devotee’s attitude. When this attitude – is confirmed, the devotee easily goes beyond the Gunas, and the Brahmanubhuti comes to him of its own accord. To be constantly thinking of the Lord, his wonderful power, beauty, joy, peace, bliss and blessedness, to love Him as the life of his life and the soul of his soul, to see Him in all beings, in all actions, and thoughts, to sing His name and glory, to offer up everything to Him,- this is Bhakti. As Bhakti is more congenial for embodied human beings, the Lord emphasises the need for it in attaining the highest state of the Gunatita and Brahmajnana.",

    "commentary": "Having declared that His devotee crosses the three Gunas and attains Paramatma, the Lord here reveals his true nature as the Supreme Brahman Himself. Lord Krishna, the teacher of the Gita is not a mortal, but Paramatma Himself, the Supreme Brahman. Sri Krishna is not simply the son of Yasoda, the cow-herd boy of the Brindavan, He is verily Paramatma. He is the eternal Dharma; He is bliss Absolute; He is the Immortal and the Immutable. Therefore who worships Him with undivided mind, by the law (\nYadbhavam tadbhavati\n) – that man becomes That which he contemplates, transcends the Gunas and becomes one with the Lord. What is that Paramatman? The Lord explains by three attributes :\nThat is Immortal (deathless and therefore birthless); That is Immutable (unchanging).\nThat is eternal Dharma;\nThat is bliss absolute.\nBy the first (Immortality and Immutability), the ‘sat’ aspect of Brahman is stated; by the second (Eternal Dharma), the ‘chit’ aspect of Brahman is stated; and by the third (Bliss absolute), and ‘ananda’ aspect of Brahman is stated. Thus the Lord declares that He is Brahman, Existence Absolute, Knowledge Absolute, and Bliss (Ananda) Absolute.\nFor the sake of easy forms of worship, the Lord appears as the son of Yasoda, as the Cow-herd boy of Brindavan, as the lover of the Gopis, as the Charioteer of Arjuna (Parthasarathi) and in a hundred other detectable forms. He, the Lord, is again all the ‘Avataras’. He is Rama, the son of Dasaratha; He is Narasimha, the destroyer of Hiranyakasipu and the saviour of Prahlada; He is Vamana; He is all this Universe, and all its spectacular manifestations. There is nothing beyond Him. He is all. The devotees should always remember that whatever form they may worship, the Lord is the supreme Sachidananda Brahman.\nBy this verse, Dualism, Qualified monism and Advaita are declared to be One in the end. The end is the same though the means are different. The Lord whom the Dualists worship as the repository of all blessed qualities (\nAnanta kalyana gunabhirama\n) is not different from the Brahman of the sages. While the ‘Sat’ aspect of Brahman is common to both, the devotee emphasises the ‘ananda’ aspect of Brahman, and the Jnani the ‘chit’ aspect. But it is declared here that ‘Chit’ (Knowledge) is not separate or distinct from Ananda’ (bliss). There is no essential difference between Jnana and Bhakti; for, both types of sadhana culminate in the realisation of the Supreme. Each man can choose his own method and form of worhsip and reach the goal.",
