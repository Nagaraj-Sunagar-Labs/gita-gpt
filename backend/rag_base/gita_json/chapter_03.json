    "commentary": "In verses\n49\n,\n50\n,\n51\nof Samkhya Yoga, the Lord declared the superiority of knowledge to action. The doubt might have crept into Arjuna’s mind even then. But the Lord proceeded to speak of samadhi, and the ultimate union of the individual with Paramatma, and hence Arjuna simply put the question about the characteristics of the sthitaprajana. The Lord answered the question and explained the highest Brahmi Sthiti and the Samkhya Yoga comes to an end with it. Now Arjuna wanted to have the doubt cleared by the Lord, how he should reconcile the two paths of knowledge (Juana) and work (Karma). So he presents his doubt in the first two verses.\nBhagavad Gita 3.1 by Swami Sarvapriyananda\nBhagavad Gita: Chapter 3 🔻\n(43 Verses)\n01\n02\n03\n04\n05\n06\n07\n08\n09\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n❮ Previous\nNext ❯",

    "commentary": "The word iva (as it were) is used twice in this verse. It means that Arjuna has full faith in the Lord, that he is not actually puzzling the intellect, but that, out of his own ignorance, it appears to him that the two doctrines of Jnana and Karma are contradictory to each other. Hence with child-like innocence, Arjuna wants to know for certain what course would be best for him to attain the highest.\nBhagavad Gita 3.2 by Swami Sarvapriyananda\n❮ Previous\nNext ❯",

    "translation": "The Blessed Lord said: O sinless Arjuna! In ancient times two paths of spiritual description were spoken by me – the Jnana yoga for the followers of the path of knowledge, and Karma yoga for the followers of the path of action.",
    "commentary": "O Sinless:\nArjuna is free from sin. So he is fully qualified to receive the highest wisdom. When the cloth is clean, it can be dyed in any colour. The Lord knew the purity of Arjuna’s mind, and therefore he chose to teach him Brahma Vidya. Each individual, according to his ingrained disposition, seeks the path which is congenial to his nature. Some are born with an intellectual frame of mind and the path for them is that of enquiring into the Self (Jnana yoga). For these, the Lord taught the path of knowledge. Others are born with a practical temperament, and they love action. For them, the Lord pointed out another path – karma yoga. Each man is perfectly free to choose his own path. There is no compulsion. Any course of imposed discipline will go against nature, and will not yield the desired result. There may be many roads leading to the same destination. There may be different routes to climb up a peak. Any route will ultimately take the people to the top of the mountain. So the Lord here declares that man may follow any path which is agreeable to his character and reach the goal. Though in the Gita several yogas are stated, all of them can be brought under these two main divisions – Jnana Yoga and Karma Yoga.\nThe Lord says that he taught the two-fold path in times immemorial. So he is beyond time and place. He is Paramatma, appearing in the form of Sri Krishna and teaching the highest om to humanity.\nBhagavad Gita 3.3 by Swami Sarvapriyananda\nSwami Vivekananda Says —\nArjuna asks: “You just advised action, and yet you uphold knowledge of Brahman as the highest form of life. Krishna, if you think that knowledge is better than action, why do you tell me to act?” [Shri Krishna]: “From ancient times these two systems have come down to us. The Sankhya philosophers advance the theory of knowledge. The Yogis advance the theory of work.\n[Source]\nBut it is a most difficult thing to give up the clinging to this universe; few ever attain to that. There are two ways to do that mentioned in our books. One is called the “neti, neti ” (not this, not this), the other is called “iti ” (this); the former is the negative, and the latter is the positive way. The negative way is the most difficult. It is only possible to the men of the very highest, exceptional minds and gigantic wills who simply stand up and say, “No, I will not have this,” and the mind and body obey their will, and they come out successful. But such people are very rare. The vast majority of mankind choose the positive way, the way through the world, making use of all the bondages themselves to break those very bondages. This is also a kind of giving up; only it is done slowly and gradually, by knowing things, enjoying things and thus obtaining experience, and knowing the nature of things until the mind lets them all go at last and becomes unattached. The former way of obtaining non-attachment is by reasoning, and the latter way is through work and experience. The first is the path of jnana-yoga and is characterized by the refusal to do any work; the second is that of karma-yoga, in which there is no cessation from work.\n[Source]\n❮ Previous\nNext ❯",

    "translation": "Man does not match the actionless state of Brahman by mere non-performance of work, nor does he attain perfection by renunciation only.",
    "commentary": "The first line of the verse refers to Karma Yoga and the second line Jnana Yoga.\nBy simply declining to do the prescribed duties. man cannot reach the still, actionless of Brahman. In the same way, by merely adopting the external formalities of Sanyasa, no man can attain liberation. What is needed for perfection is the purity of mind.\nUnless work is done without attachment there cannot be purity of mind; without purity knowledge of Atma will not dawn; without knowledge, there is no Moksha (liberation). Therefore the Lord here declares that there is no moksha for the man who does not work. In the beginning, all seekers should undertake some form of work and learn to do it without hankering after the fruits thereof. and in the final stages, they attain the experience of Self. No one gains Moksha by merely giving up work. lf that is so, the idlers would be the greatest philosophers of the world! On the other hand. such men fall deeper into the mire of tamas, and it would take many births for them to lift themselves up from the bog of inaction. Many ignorant people imagine that when they give up work, they simply attain Moksha, and on account of this misconception, lose worldly prosperity as much as spiritual progress. They are neither Karmayogis nor Jnanayogis. They are neither useful to the world nor to themselves, nor can they move an inch towards perfection. It is absolutely necessary to understand the position correctly.\nThe path of spiritual progress is slow and gradual. Sudden illumination never occurs except in very rare cases. Everyone should pass from tamas to rajas, from rajas to sattva, and from sattva to pure sattva when Self is realised. The first step is the performance of prescribed duties by so disciplining the body and mind that they take to action easily and naturally. Therefore the Lord here declares that the final experience of Brahman is not an easily attainable objective by merely giving up one’s duties. Work should be done, without attachment. That is the trumpet of the Lord. Moreover, it is utterly useless to renounce work while all the inherent tendencies of the mind and heart are actively and powerfully functioning in their own way without any check or control. Nothing good can come from mere external renunciation of action. The spiritual aim cannot be achieved by that.\nThe question is not whether to work or give up work. The main issue is how to get inner purity of mind and heart, how to eradicate the evil impulses and instincts which have taken root in the depths of the human personality. Towards this end, the Lord prescribed selfless work. He exhorts all men to undertake some form of good work and do it without any motive of gain or profit, and with a spirit of dedication to the Lord.\nBhagavad Gita 3.4 by Swami Sarvapriyananda\nSwami Vivekananda Says —\nKrishna strikes another note as a teacher of intense activity. Work, work, work day and night, says the Gita. You may ask, “Then, where is peace? If all through life I am to work like a cart-horse and die in harness, what am I here for?” Krishna says, “Yes, you will find peace. Flying from work is never the way to find peace.” Throw off your duties if you can, and go to the top of a mountain; even there the mind is going — whirling, whirling, whirling. Someone asked a sannyasin, “Sir, have you found a nice place? How many years have you been travelling in the Himalayas?” “For forty years,” replied the sannyasin. “There are so many beautiful spots to select from, and to settle down in: why did you not do so?” “Because for these forty years my mind would not allow me to do so.” We all say, “Let us find peace”; but the mind will not allow us to do so.\n[Source]\nOne must do some work. Through work alone can one remove the bondage of work, not by avoiding work. Total detachment comes later on. One should not be without work even for a moment.\n(p.14-5, The Gospel Of Holy Mother, Mother’s advice to a devotee on 18 September 1912)\nIsa Upanishad Verse 9, 10 & 11\n: Into a blind darkness they enter who are devoted to ignorance (rituals); but into a greater darkness they enter who engage in knowledge of a deity alone. One thing, they say, is obtained from knowledge; another, they say, from ignorance. Thus we have heard from the wise who have taught us this. He who is aware that both knowledge and ignorance should be pursued together, overcomes death through ignorance and obtains immortality through knowledge.",

    "translation": "No one can live even for a moment without doing work. Everyone without his will is made to do work by the qualities born of Prakriti.",
    "commentary": "No one can live without work even for a second. Breathing is work, eating is work, walking is work, talking is work. So it is known to all that work is a part of life itself.\nExcept the Jnani, everyone else is subject to Maya (Prakriti). And the impulses of the mind compel all people to do some kind of work or other according to their nature. The scholar cannot live without the study of books. The idler cannot live without aimless wandering. The learned and the ignorant are acting under the power of the qualities born of Prakriti. Each according to his nature is doing some work or other, over which he has no control. The law applies to all beings in the world. Animals and birds work according to their nature. Each has its own peculiar characteristics. Man being endowed with reason (buddhi) may choose the work, but what is chosen is also according to his nature. So it is true that all are prompted by Prakriti. Here the word\nsarvah\nis used with only the single exception of the Jnani, who has become a Jivanmukta by direct realisation of the Supreme, having attained the\nBrahmi-sthiti\nthe Jnani transcends the gunas, and so he is not moved by the impulses arising from the qualities of nature. But since he has a body that is the instrument of Prakriti, he uses it just for maintaining life. He is perfectly detached from the vehicle of action.\nThe ignorant people who are every minute dragged and whirled about in all directions by the forces of nature need not however be discouraged. They should first of all understand that they have become slaves to certain modes of thought and action, which they have themselves created in previous births. Knowing it, they should undertake some form of discipline, and by their own effort overcome bad by good karma, surrender the fruits of work to the Lord, and gradually purify their mind, and become Jeevanmuktas in the end.\nBhagavad Gita 3.5 by Swami Sarvapriyananda\nSwami Vivekananda Says —\nMaking Swami Akhandananda the subject of his remarks, Swamiji said to the disciple, “Mark you, what a great hero he is in work! Of fear, death and the like he has no cognisance — doggedly going on doing his own work — ‘work for the welfare of the many, for the happiness of the many’.”",

    "translation": "But, O Arjuna! he who controls the senses with the mind, and commences the discipline of Karma yoga by his organs of action without attachment, is the best.",
    "commentary": "Both the organs of action and inner instruments of cognition are included in the practice of karma yoga. Then only the discipline is complete. It is the mind that moves the bodily organs of action and the sense-organs of perception. So the mind should be kept detached from desire and longing for material pleasures. Such a man does his prescribed work without any desire for personal enjoyment.\nThe senses and instruments of action should be under the control of the mind, and the mind should be under one’s control. Bondage results from mental attachment to material objects, whether the body and the senses work or remain inactive. So the point is how to keep the mind free from becoming entangled in the meshes of the material world. Such freedom is its Moksha. So the Lord here says that, when the mind is kept free and pure, though a man moves and works in the world, he is not affected by it at all. Keeping the mind in a pure and harmonised state comes first, and the control of the body and the senses follow as a natural effect. Great men have done immortal work for the benefit of humanity by following this law.\nBhagavad Gita 3.7 by Swami Sarvapriyananda\nSwami Vivekananda Says —\nBut none can attain to peace by renouncing actions. None in this life can stop activity even for a moment. Nature’s qualities [gunas] will make him act. He who stops his activities and at the same time is still thinking about them attains to nothing; he only becomes a hypocrite. But he who by the power of his mind gradually brings his sense-organs under control, employing them in work, that man is better. Therefore do thou work.\n[Source]\nSwami Saradananda is a glowing example of a person who could keep his mind in God, or the Self, and at the same time his hands at work. A real yogi regards the Self as actionless even while being engaged in action. Activity belongs to the body, the senses, and the mind, and does not affect the unchanging Self. The Gita says, “Great is the man who controls the senses with his mind and engages them in selfless actions” (3.7).\nMonks tend to go into seclusion for meditation, giving up action. To them Saradananda said: “Remove your doubt forever, my boys, and remember what I say today. Those who attain the summum bonum here will also attain it there, and those who do not attain it here will never attain it there.” (By here and there the swami meant work and seclusion.) On another occasion, while in Puri, he told a monk who was not well but nonetheless was anxious to return to work in his centre: “Look, after doing such voluminous work in my life I have this knowledge that we do nothing; we are mere instruments. Everything happens according to the will of the Master. Previously I used to think that without me this particular work would suffer. During my absence who would do this work? Now I see for want of anybody, the Master’s work will not stop.” (Source: God Lived with Them)",

The Lord commands Arjuna to be up and active in the performance of his duty.\nIt is befitting the universality of the Gita to give to this word karma a larger interpretation than the mere performance of ritual. Man is continuously acting in various fields of personal, social, and national life. He is at work in the house, in the office or factory, in the co-operation endeavour of national projects. All this is karma. The Lord’s observation that even physical existence becomes impossible by inaction, should be understood as a call to the nation to work and work hard for its own and universal benefit.

    "translation": "O Arjuna! Works other than those performed for the sake of sacrifice (Yajna) binds this world. So perform work for sacrifice without attachment.",
    "commentary": "The teacher of the Gita dives new interpretations to familiarise with terms like yajna, sannyasa, tyaga etc. Ordinarily, yajna means a certain form of ritual, accompanied with the sacred fire, oblations, mantras and tantras, and other rites. The Lord defines the word as an act performed with no selfish motive for the service or humanity. Whatever may be the scope of work, great or small, if it is done as an act of dedication to God and service to beings, it becomes a yajna. This is within the capability of all men to perform and acquire merit. Generally, it is a mistaken view to think that karma binds men to Samsara. And even if it is good work, man has to be born again and again to enjoy the fruits of such\nkarma\n. They argue that karma should be given up. But the Lord clears this misconception. When karma is done with the desire of enjoying its fruits, it binds man to the wheel of birth and death. What is done without desire and attachment cannot bind man. On the other hand, it purifies the mind and heart and leads to ultimate freedom.\nWork done with attachment binds; the same work performed without attachment, liberates. Work performed as dedicated to God or as service to mankind liberates. So there is nothing evil in work as such. The evil lies in the personal motive behind it – the desire for reward and enjoyment. The Lord exhorts Arjuna to work intensely (samachara). But he wants his disciple to understand the principle behind work. One should understand it correctly and go into action. Otherwise he is caught in the meshes of karma. The law of work is thus explained here. 1. Yajna should be done as an act of dedication to God and as a service to humanity. 2. Yajna should be done without any attachment for the fruits thereof. Work done in this spirit, though it is of a common quality is transformed into a great yajna. Work then becomes worthier. It purifies and liberates.\nBhagavad Gita 3.9-16 by Swami Sarvapriyananda\nHow to serve without attachment\n… Swami Sadananda recalled: “Once in the northwest I was on my way to meet a brother disciple. I was supposed to arrive in the evening, but the train was delayed and I did not arrive until midnight. Instead of disturbing anybody at that hour, I slept on the veranda of a dharamshala. In the morning, I found a leprosy patient lying next to me. At first I felt some hesitation, but then by the grace of the guru, the thought of Swamiji spontaneously arose in my mind. I said to myself: ‘Lord Shiva Himself is lying beside me in the form of this leper to receive my service!’ Soon I managed to heat up some water, and with a clean piece of cloth I cleaned his blisters. When I later reached my brother disciple, I arranged for some medical help and a good diet for that man for a few days.”\nSwami Sadananda said: “Through such service, the heart expands so much that after experiencing it once, one does not want to lose that joy of service. Simply carrying on one’s duties monotonously as a routine will not do. Unless one feels that he is worshipping Lord Shiva Himself through his work, he will end up with a dry feeling. Moreover, egotism and pride will raise their heads, and there will be factionalism. Swamiji made this idea firm in my mind. Serve, but after the work is finished, contemplate and meditate on God. The mind should not think of that work again. This is service done without attachment.” (Source: Stories of Vedanta Monks – Volume II by Swami Chetanananda)\n“Work should be looked upon as a Yajna, a sacrifice. The whole work should be done perfectly, even as one would perform a sacrifice. Every work should be considered a spiritual discipline, a means to God-realization. Only thus will character be formed.” …..\n…..”To be successful in any work, you must look upon the work itself as your ideal. You may have a fancy for a work for a day or two and then give it up as soon as it loses charm. This is no good. Shashi Maharaj (Swami Ramakrishnananda) demonstrated in his life how to work. For sixteen years he followed the same routine in the same place. Some-times his sufferings became so intense that he abused Shri Ramakrishna and Swamiji in the strongest language. Still he did not give up the work entrusted to him.”\n“Work for work’s sake. Your whole mind should be fixed upon the work. Let that be your ideal, the be-all and end-all of life. Never mind success or failure.” — Swami Turiyananda (Source: Spiritual Talks by the First Disciples of Sri Ramakrishna)\nSwami Turiyananda(Referring to D. who was present): “He is daily going down into Tamas, becoming more and more lazy in the name of spiritual progress. They think that inaction in itself is the ideal. If it be so, why, then the wall also should be considered to have attained Samadhi. Should not one transcend all dualities? To maintain one’s mental balance under all circumstances, to remain absolutely unmoved – that indeed is the goal!\n“Worship of Narayana-how exquisite! This is the characteristic of the present age. Meditation and work both are excellent, if properly done. They are equally good.\n“The idea once prevailed that Swamiji has preached differently from Shri Ramakrishna. That idea is considerably discredited now.\nPractice of medicine is bad if you seek remuneration. Selflessly done, it leads to salvation. They say that work binds. Well, if it binds, it also unbinds.\nWhat kind of meditation is this, half an hour in the morning and half an hour in the evening! Must not there be an uninterrupted flow throughout the day? Closing eyes for a few minutes and spending the remaining day in gossip! One must try long and hard, only then can one have realization.\n“As you sow, so you reap. If you want anything, start seeking it at once. You may not be able to do the best, but do as best as you can. Now or never!” (Source: Spiritual Talks by the First Disciples of Sri Ramakrishna)\nSwami Turiyananda: “Work done in the spirit of service can lead one as surely to the goal as meditation and Japa.\n“The Gitâ read between the lines, is found to emphasize work. There is a deeper meaning behind its saying that the Jnâni has no work to do. It means that he has not, like the ordinary worker, any egoistic feeling attached to his work.\n“All those old ideas that the Sannyasin should renounce all works except begging, can no more satisfy us, especially after we have been enlightened by the life and teachings of the Master and Swamiji. They have thrown a new light on these things, they have given a new expression to the ancient light.”\nHearing that a certain work was incon-venienced for want of a trained worker, the Swami said, “Never mind. Do your best. Work yourself to death, if need be. Nothing but good will come of it.\n“\nI am against our work being done by paid men.\nBetter you wind it up…. Go on working, ready to sacrifice even life for the Master’s work. I am sure he will provide all necessary help in time. Do not worry.\n“I do not at all like the idea of separating work from worship. Work is worship. All work is His service.\nI have seen that people who practise austerities in solitude often become selfish. But the worker has to mix and live with many for the sake of his work and has thus to cultivate patience, sympathy, love, and selflessness. Besides Upasana (worship) also is work, and its fruits also have to be dedicated to the Lord.\n” (Source: Spiritual Talks by the First Disciples of Sri Ramakrishna)\nBhagavad Gita: Chapter 3 🔻\n(43 Verses)\n01\n02\n03\n04\n05\n06\n07\n08\n09\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43",

Man needs above everything else the removal of sorrow and the attainment of peace. They can be achieved by performing yajna. Therefore it is compared to the wish-fulfilling Kamadhenu of Heaven. Not only the spiritual welfare of mankind but also their material prosperity is answered by the performance of yajna.\nBhagavad Gita: Chapter 3 🔻\n(43 Verses)\n01\n02\n03\n04\n05\n06\n07\n08\n09\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43",

Man’s effort and God’s grace are both necessary for liberation.\nEven in the common affairs of life, the man who links himself with the Lord finds protection from dangers in the daily turmoil of life and obtains all-around prosperity. Better it is to depend on the Lord than on ordinary mortals who are subject to all the ills of life. They may help or not help according to their self-interest. In any way, such contact with mortal benefactors comes to an end with death.

    "translation": "Nourished by sacrifice, the Gods, give you desirable enjoyments. He who enjoys objects given by the Gods without offering them is verily a thief.",
    "commentary": "When the Gods are worshipped by means of sacrifice, they confer on mankind many material blessings and prevent many material calamities. He who enjoys these material things without offering them to the Gods or to fellow – beings in the form of God, is indeed a thief because he enjoys objects without paying the price for them. Food, water, air, and other things which we use belong to God. They are not manufactured by us. What we call the discoveries and inventions of modern science are combinations and modifications of things already created, and the utilisation of powers already present in nature. In fact, even the intelligence of man is itself the gift of God. So from first to last, in every way, and for every thing, man is indebted to God. Anyone who forgets to offer Him what belongs to him only should be regarded as a thief. Gratitude and devotion are the proper price that one should pay to enjoy the fruits of life. Offering them to God or to fellow beings is the first duty for all mankind. Otherwise, people will lay themselves open to the charge of being robbers and dacoits who misappropriate what does not belong to them.\nHow many people follow this law? Of what avail is it to acquire name and fame, wealth and learning in the eyes of humanity, when in the eyes of God people are only thieves and robbers? Moreover, even in this earthly life, the thief is condemned and punished. If so, will there be no punishment when one robs things belonging to God? They shall of course pay the full penalty for such misappropriation. So let the seekers who desire to win the grace of God make it their duty to give something to the fellow mortals (dana) – a morsel of food or a cup of water to the needy every day before they enjoy the food. Let them offer their whole to God, and think that nothing belongs to them. All is offered to God in the spirit of Brahmarpanam or Sarvam Sri Krishnarpanamasathu. Thus one repays the debt of gratitude that he owes to God for the innumerable blessings which He has conferred on mankind.",

    "translation": "The righteous who offer food to the Gods in sacrifice and eat the remnants are freed from all sins. But those who cook food to satisfy their own needs, are sinners and verily eat sin.",
    "commentary": "To cherish the Gods by offering food to them in sacrifice or to offer food to fellow mortals – the poor and hungry-and then to eat the remnants is an act of righteousness capable of destroying all sins. Not one or two sins, but all the horrible sins of man are cleansed by this act of divine or human offering. We understand from this what a powerful antidote yajna is to destroy all types of accumulated sins. Divine offering, compassionate relief given to suffering fellow-beings,-this is the best remedy to kill all sins. So it is said in the Esavasyopanishad –\n“From what you have, give something as a sacrifice to the Gods or other fellow beings, and eat the remaining portion.”\nThe selfish who cooks and eats all to satisfy his own bodily needs is indeed eating not food, but sin! Such men accumulate sin They eat and digest sin and they become living embodiments Of sin. So it is clear that sacrifice leads to the highest good and selfishness leads to the worst sin and suffering. Such food not offered to the Gods or fellow beings is poison, though it is the richest and the most relishing. And that food sacrificed to Gods and offered to fellow beings is nectar though it is simple boiled rice and water.\nAccording to Vedic traditions, man commits five kinds of sin each day by the use of (1) the broomstick, (2) the waterpot (3) the mortar and pestle, (4) the grinding stone, and (5) the oven. To eliminate these sins, the Pancha maha yajnas are prescribed. They are (1) Deva Yajna (2) Brahma Yajna (3) Pitri Yajna, (4) Nri Yajna and (5) Bhuta Yajna. The Vedic tradition has prescribed many types of yajnas to eliminate the sins committed in the course of innumerable births. The generalisation is that all sins would be cleared by sacrifice. All acts performed as worship of God or service to fellow beings not simply a man but animals, birds, and all lesser manifestations of life create a sinless state of purity that enables man to realise the spiritual aim.",

Those who do not follow the Dharma Chakra forget God and run after the mirage of sensual pleasures. So they accumulate sin. They are described as “living in sin” (Aghayuh).

    "commentary": "Except for the Paramahamsa who has directly experienced the Supreme Self, for all others Karma yoga is the inevitable law. In this verse, the Lord describes the liberated sage. He finds all joy in Atma, all satisfaction in Atma, all contentment in Atma. He does not move outside Atma. For him, the law of karma does not apply because he has already realised the highest fruit of karma (i.e.) Moksha. So he is released from the operation of the law of karma. But still, if he works, he does so for the benefit of mankind. There is no harm whether he works or does not work.\nSuch realised sages are very rare indeed. All the others must work. They should endeavour to attain the highest state by diligent performance of yajna. They should understand what they are, where they are, how they live, and avoid the dangerous delusion of giving up karma before reaching the goal.\nIt would be as foolish to do so as to throw away the leaf before eating the food.\nIn modern times the attachment and distractions of the material world have assumed dangerous proportions. Man has sunk into the mire of material pleasures and is caught by them in a ready embrace from which he is not able to extricate himself. He is not able to conceive of anything higher than food and sex. The true joy of life is lost. Man is reduced to the level of animal creation. It would be understood by the purified intellect that joy and happiness cannot arise from dead matter. It is the greatest error to think so. True joy is actually flooding the heart of all people. What one imagines as joy coming from external objects is only reflected. Atmic happiness is ever-present in the heart. To know this is Jnana. Not to know this is Maya. The realised sage is perfectly contented because he knows that all the joys, delights, and pleasures of the material world are comprehended in the happiness of the Self. Knowing and realising this, he does not hanker for sense-pleasures. He does not go outside himself to seek for – this or that as the ignorant man does. He is Atmarama, Atmatripta, Atmatushta. The general term man (manavah) is used to show that no one is denied the merit of Self-realisation for reasons of caste, creed, or sex.\nBhagavad Gita 3.17 by Swami Sarvapriyananda\nSwami Vivekananda Says —\n“He whose joy is only in himself, whose desires are only in himself, he has learned his lessons.” This is the great lesson that we are here to learn through myriads of births and heavens and hells — that there is nothing to be asked for, desired for, beyond one’s Self.\n[\nSource\n]\nAs the Gita says, “He whose devotion is to the Atman, he who does not want anything beyond Atman, he who has become satisfied in the Atman, what work is there for him to do?”\n[Source]\nThe highest men are calm, silent, and unknown. They are the men who really know the power of thought; they are sure that even if they go into a cave and close the door and simply think five true thoughts and then pass away, these five thoughts of theirs will live through eternity. Indeed such thoughts will penetrate through the mountains, cross the oceans, and travel through the world. They will enter deep into human hearts and brains and raise up men and women who will give them practical expression in the workings of human life. These sattvika men are too near the Lord to be active and to fight, to be working, struggling, preaching, and doing good, as they say, here on earth to humanity. The active workers, however good, have still a little remnant of ignorance left in them. When our nature has yet some impurities left in it, then alone can we work. It is in the nature of work to be impelled ordinarily by motive and by attachment. In the presence of an ever active Providence who notes even the sparrow’s fall, how can man attach any importance to his own work? Will it not be a blasphemy to do so when we know that He is taking care of the minutest things in the world? We have only to stand in awe and reverence before Him saying, “Thy will be done”. The highest men cannot work, for in them there is no attachment. Those whose whole soul is gone into the Self, those whose desires are confined in the Self, who have become ever associated with the Self, for them there is no work. Such are indeed the highest of mankind; but apart from them every one else has to work.\n[Source]\nEvery one must work in the universe. Only those who are perfectly satisfied with the Self, whose desires do not go beyond the Self, whose mind never strays out of the Self, to whom the Self is all in all, only those do not work. The rest must work.\n[Source]\nSri Ramakrishna Says —\n“The Vedas speak of seven planes where the mind dwells. When the mind is immersed in worldliness it dwells in the three lower planes — at the navel, the organ of generation, and the organ of evacuation. In that state the mind loses all its higher visions — it broods only on ‘woman and gold’. The fourth plane of the mind is at the heart. When the mind dwells there, one has the first glimpse of spiritual consciousness. One sees light all around. Such a man, perceiving the divine light, becomes speechless with wonder and says: ‘Ah! What is this? What is this?’ His mind does not go downward to the objects of the world.\n“The fifth plane of the mind is at the throat. When the mind reaches this, the aspirant becomes free from all ignorance and illusion. He does not enjoy talking or hearing about anything but God. If people talk about worldly things, he leaves the place at once.\n“The sixth plane is at the forehead. When the mind reaches it, the aspirant sees the form of God day and night. But even then a little trace of ego remains. At the sight of that incomparable beauty of God’s form, one becomes intoxicated and rushes forth to touch and embrace it. But one doesn’t succeed. It is like the light inside a lantern. One feels as if one could touch the light, but one cannot on account of the pane of glass.\n“In the top of the head is the seventh plane. When the mind rises there, one goes into samadhi. Then the Brahmajnani directly perceives Brahman. But in that state his body does not last many days. He remains unconscious of the outer world. If milk is poured into his mouth, it runs out. Dwelling on this plane of consciousness, he gives up his body in twenty-one days. That is the condition of the Brahmajnani. But yours is the path of devotion. That is a very good and easy path.\n“Once a man said to me, ‘Sir, can you teach me quickly the thing you call samadhi?’ (\nAll laugh\n.)\n“After a man has attained samadhi all his actions drop away. All devotional activities, such as worship, japa, and the like, as well as all worldly duties, cease to exist for such a person. At the beginning there is much ado about work. As a man makes progress toward God, the outer display of his work becomes less and less — so much so that he cannot even sing the name and glories of God. (\nTo Sivanath\n) As long as you were not here at the meeting, people talked a great deal about you and discussed your virtues. But no sooner did you arrive here than all that stopped. Now the very sight of you makes everyone happy. People now simply say, ‘Ah! Here is Shivanath Babu.’ All other talk about you has stopped.\n“After attaining samadhi, I once went to the Ganges to perform tarpan. But as I took water in the palm of my hand, it trickled down through my fingers. Weeping, I said to Haladhari, “Cousin, what is this?’ Haladhari replied, ‘It is called galitahasta (Literally, “inert and benumbed hand”.) in the holy books.’ After the vision of God, such duties as the performance of tarpan drop away.\n“In the kirtan the devotee first sings, ‘Nitai amar mata hati.’ (“My Nitai dances like a mad elephant.”) As the devotional mood deepens, he simply sings, ‘Hati! Hati!’ Next, all he can sing is ‘Hati’. And last of all he simply sings, ‘Ha!’ and goes into samadhi. The man who has been singing all the while then becomes speechless.\n“Again, at a feast given to the brahmins one at first hears much noise of talking. When the guests sit on the floor with leaf-plates in front of them, much of the noise ceases. Then one hears only the cry, ‘Bring some luchi!’ As they partake of the luchi and other dishes, three quarters of the noise subsides. When the curd, the last course, appears, one hears only the sound ‘soop, soop’ as the guests eat the curd with their fingers. Then there is practically no noise. Afterwards all retire to sleep, and absolute silence reigns.\n“Therefore I say, at the beginning of religious life a man makes much ado about work, but as his mind dives deeper into God, he becomes less active. Last of all comes the renunciation of work, followed by samadhi. (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\n—–\nSHRISH:\n“Under the pressure of duties people do many unrighteous things in the world. Further, some are engaged in good work, and some in evil. Is this due to their actions in previous births? Is that why they act this way?”\nMASTER:\n“How long should a man perform his duties? As long as he has not attained God. Duties drop away after the realisation of God. Then one goes beyond good and evil. The flower drops off as soon as the fruit appears. The flower serves the purpose of begetting the fruit.\n“How long should a devotee perform daily devotions such as the sandhya? As long as his hair does not stand on end and his eyes do not shed tears at the name of God. These things indicate that the devotee has realised God, From these one knows that he has attained pure love of God. Realizing God one goes beyond virtue and vice.\nI bow my head, says Prasad, before desire and liberation;\nKnowing the secret that Kali is one with the highest Brahman,\nI have discarded, once for all, both righteousness and sin.\n“The more you advance toward God, the less He will give you worldly duties to perform.” (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\n—–\n“Formal worship drops away after the vision of God. It was thus that my worship in the temple came to an end. I used to worship the Deity in the Kali temple. It was suddenly revealed to me that everything is Pure Spirit. The utensils of worship, the altar, the door-frame—all Pure Spirit. Men, animals, and other living beings — all Pure Spirit. Then like a madman I began to shower flowers in all directions. Whatever I saw I worshipped.\n“One day, while worshipping Siva, I was about to offer a bel-leaf on the head of the image, when it was revealed to me that this Virat, this Universe, itself is Siva. After that my worship of Siva through the image came to an end. Another day I had been plucking flowers, when it was revealed to me that the flowering plants were so many bouquets.” (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\n—–\n“Without having realised God one cannot give up rituals altogether. How long should one practise the sandhya and other forms of ritualistic worship? As long as one does not shed tears of joy at the name of God and feel a thrill in one’s body. You will know that your ritualistic worship has come to an end when your eyes become filled with tears as you repeat ‘Om Rama’. Then you do not have to continue your sandhya or other rituals.\n“When the fruit appears the blossom drops off. Love of God is the fruit, and rituals are the blossom. When the daughter-in-law of the house becomes pregnant, she cannot do much work. Her mother-in-law gradually lessens her duties in the house. When her time arrives she does practically nothing. And after the child is born her only work is to play with it. She doesn’t do any household duties at all. The sandhya merges in the Gayatri, the Gayatri in Om, and Om in samadhi. It is like the sound of a bell:\nt — a — m\n. The yogi, by following in the trail of the sound Om, gradually merges himself in the Supreme Brahman. His sandhya and other ritualistic duties disappear in samadhi. Thus the duties of the jnani come to an end.” (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\n—–\nIn order to perform the worship of God you will be preoccupied for a long time with such religious duties as plucking flowers, making sandal-paste, polishing the utensils of worship, and arranging offerings. As you perform these duties your mind will naturally be directed to God. You will get rid of meanness, anger, jealousy, and so forth. When you two sisters talk to each other, always talk about spiritual matters.\n“The thing is somehow to unite the mind with God. You must not forget Him, not even once. Your thought of Him should be like the flow of oil, without any interruption (\nBG 6.19\n). It you worship with love even a brick or stone as God, then through His grace you can see Him.\n“Remember what I have just said to you. One should perform such worship as the Siva Puja. Once the mind has become mature, one doesn’t have to continue formal worship for long. The mind then always remains united with God; meditation and contemplation become a constant habit of mind.” (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\n—–\nISHAN:\n“After the attainment of God, religious duties such as the sandyha drop away. One day some people were sitting on the bank of the Ganges performing the sandyha. But one of them abstained from it. On being asked the reason, he said:\n‘I am observing asoucha. I cannot perform the sandyha ceremony.\n6\nIn my case the defilement is due to both a birth and a death. My mother, Ignorance, is dead, and my son, Self-Knowledge, has been born.’\n” (\nBG 3.17\n,\nBG 3.18\n,\nMaitreya Upanishad 2.13-2.15\n)\nMASTER:\n“Tell us, also, how caste distinctions drop away when one attains Self-Knowledge.”\nISHAN:\n“Sankaracharya was once climbing the steps after finishing his bath in the Ganges, when he saw just in front of him an untouchable who had a pack of dogs with him. ‘You have touched me!’ said Sankara. ‘Revered sir,’ said the pariah, “I have not touched you, nor have you touched me.\nThe Self is the Inner Ruler of all beings and cannot be contaminated.\nIs there any difference between the sun’s reflection in wine and its reflection in the Ganges?'” (\nBG 6.29\n,\nBG 13.28\n,\nBG 13.29\n) (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\n—–\n“The whole thing is to love God and taste His sweetness. He is sweetness and the devotee is its enjoyer. The devotee drinks the sweet Bliss of God. Further, God is the lotus and the devotee the bee. The devotee sips the honey of the lotus.\n“As a devotee cannot live without God, so also God cannot live without His devotee. Then the devotee becomes the sweetness, and God its enjoyer. The devotee becomes the lotus, and God the bee. It is the Godhead that has become these two in order to enjoy Its own Bliss. That is the significance of the episode of Radha and Krishna.\n“\nAt the beginning of spiritual life the devotee should observe such rites as pilgrimage, putting a string of beads around his neck, and so forth. But outward ceremonies gradually drop off as he attains the goal, the vision of God. Then his only activity is the repetition of God’s name, and contemplation and meditation on Him.\n(Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\n—–\nWhen, hearing the name of Hari or Rāma once, you shed tears and your hair stands on end, then you may know for certain that you do not have to perform such devotions as the sandhyā any more. Then only will you have a right to renounce rituals; or rather, rituals will drop away of themselves. Then it will be enough if you repeat only the name of Rāma or Hari, or even simply Om. The sandhyā merges in the Gāyatri, and the Gāyatri merges in Om.\n— Sri Ramakrishna\nWhen love of God is awakened, work drops away of itself. If God makes some men work, let them work. It is now time for you to give up everything. Renounce all and say, ‘O mind, may you and I alone behold the Mother, letting no one else intrude.’\n— Sri Ramakrishna\nSri Ramakrishna put to Nângtâ (the naked) Totâ Puri the question: “Where is the necessity of daily meditation in your present advanced state?” Totâ replied that a brass-vessel would lose its lustre unless scrubbed every day; one’s mind could not be kept pure without daily meditation. Sri Ramakrishna rejoined that if the vessel was made of gold it would not be tarnished. That is to say, devotional exercises were no longer necessary for one who had come to know God. (Source: Words of the Master by Swami Brahmananda)\nOne should continue to perform the Vedic ritualistic activity until one actually becomes detached from material sense gratification and develops faith for hearing and chanting about Me.\n— Srimad Bhagavatam 11.20.9\nHaving taken complete shelter at My lotus feet, however, a saintly person ultimately renounces such ordinary religious duties and worships Me alone. He is thus considered to be the best among all living entities.\n— Srimad Bhagavatam 11.11.32\nMaitreya Upanishad 2.13-2.15\n—\nII-13. No sooner has (the ascetic) moved away from the son of ego, the brother of wealth, the home of delusion and the wife of desires than he is liberated (from worldly bondage); there is no doubt about it.\nII-14-15. How shall I perform the twilight worship (Sandhya, i.e., there is no need for it) when the mother of delusion is (just) dead and the son of true awakening is born, causing two-fold impurity? How can I perform twilight worship when the bright sun of consciousness ever shines in the sky of the heart and it never sets or rises? (i.e. there is no twilight at all and hence there is no scope for worship).\nRelated Articles:\nThe Blessed Lord said: When a man renounces completely all the desires of the mind, and when he is fully satisfied with his mind fixed in Atma, then he is declared to be a man of steady wisdom.

    "commentary": "It is said that the Jivanmukta may work or may not work. In both, he has nothing to gain or lose. He is constantly rooted in the Self and is perfectly satisfied in the Self. And so. with work done or not done he has no concern whatsoever. There is nothing for him to achieve beyond the realisation of Self. So the law of Karma Yoga does not apply to him. But we find that some of the realised sages engage themselves in work to illuminate mankind with true knowledge.\nThe jivanmukta has nothing to seek from any being in the world. All pleasures, delights, and joys are in the Self, and he lives and moves and has his being in the Self. So, what would he need and to which of the Devas should he offer sacrifice? Why and what for? He has arrived at the central station of all Bliss and blessedness, the source from which all joy emanates expressing itself through the mind, the senses, and the body. All material benefits are included in Brahmananda according to the law – Satey Panchasat (Fifty is included in hundred). They have nothing to gain from anyone.\nIt should be understood that the Lord has spoken of the Jivanmukta. But the ordinary seeker has still to go a long way before reaching the goal. He should perform work with detachment and devotion to God. Of course, we see that men having completed their period of service qualify themselves for pension and live a free life. This does not apply to young men who are still students and workers. They should do their work and complete the term of work, and then only they qualify themselves to gain pension and be free from work. Otherwise, they lose their job and their livelihood. So the seeker should work with devotion and detachment, till by the grace of God, he is emancipated from the cycle of birth and death. This is the law for all common men.\nBhagavad Gita 3.18 by Swami Sarvapriyananda\nBhagavad Gita 3.17 & 3.18 by Swami Sarvapriyananda\nSri Ramakrishna Says —\n“It is by no means necessary for a man always to be engaged in his duties. Actions drop away when one realizes, God, as the flower drops of itself when the fruit appears.\n“He who has realized God no longer performs religious duties such as the sandhya. In his case the sandhya merges in the Gayatri. When that happens, it is enough for a person to repeat just the Gayatri mantra. Then the Gayatri merges in Om. After that one no longer chants even the Gayatri; it is enough then to chant simply Om. How long should a man practise such devotions as the sandhya? As long as he does not feel a thrill in his body and shed tears of joy while repeating the name of Rama or of Hari.” (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\n—–\nMASTER (\nto M\n.):\n“What need of the sandhya has a man who thinks of God day and night?\nWhat need of rituals has a man, what need of devotions any more,\nIf he repeats the Mother’s name at the three holy hours?\nRituals may pursue him close, but never can they overtake him.\nCharity, vows, and giving of gifts do not appeal to Madan’s mind;\nThe Blissful Mother’s Lotus Feet are his whole prayer and sacrifice.\n“The sandhya merges in the Gayatri, the Gayatri in Om.

    "commentary": "The principle that man attains liberation by Nishkama karma is illustrated by the example of King Janaka and others like Asvapati, Ikshvaku, Ambarisha, Bhagiradha. They were all emperors who followed the doctrine of Nishkama karma and attained the highest spiritual goal. It is an ancient way of life, and men of the greatest responsibilities in the world understood the secret of the work and practised it in their daily life. Arjuna, a prince of the Royal family of Bharata, could do it. It is an answer to the doubt whether man could attain Moksha while engaged in the practical duties of the world, and whether work could lead to liberation. Nishkama karma purifies the mind and knowledge dawns at once. It is said in the Yoga Vasista that Janaka performed many acts of righteousness without attachment, purified his mind thereby, and by enquiry into the Self, realised the Supreme Being.\nThe Lord further emphasises the need for good work even from a worldly point of view. Man should work at least to serve mankind, to show them the right path, and to set an example to them. Service to humanity has indeed a very high place in religion and philosophy. Even to help a single individual is indeed a great work. To liberate oneself, and then to lead others to spiritual illumination is undoubtedly the highest act of service to mankind. Wealth and lands, power and position could be won and lost. But emancipation and God-realisation is a blessing to humanity. So the Lord advises Arjuna to work, not only for self-purification but to show the path of work to mankind and help the masses by his personal example.\nBhagavad Gita 3.20 by Swami Sarvapriyananda\nSri Ramakrishna Says —\nReferring to Keshab’s association with “woman and gold”, which had hindered his work as a spiritual teacher, Sri Ramakrishna said to Vijay, “He — do you understand?”\nVIJAY:\n“Yes, sir.”\nMASTER:\n“He couldn’t achieve very much because he wanted to satisfy both God and the world.”\nVIJAY:\n“Chaitanya said to Nityananda: ‘Nitai, I shall not be able to do the people any good unless I renounce the world.

Chaitanyadeva renounced the world to set an example to mankind.\n“The sannyasi must renounce ‘woman and gold’ for his own welfare. Even if he is unattached, and consequently not in danger, still, in order to set an example to others, he must not keep ‘woman and gold’ near him. The sannyasi, the man of renunciation, is a world teacher. It is his example that awakens the spiritual consciousness of men.” (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)",

    "translation": "What-so-ever a great man does, that other men do; whatever he sets up as the standard, that the world follows.",
    "commentary": "The Lord argues the issue from a practical point of view. The actions of great men occupying a spectacular position in the world are observed by the common people. Naturally, they act in the same way. What the elders do, children imitate.\nWe see this daily very often that to justify one’s actions, one refers to the example of great men.\nSo, as a man acquires leadership, comes to occupy a prominent position, he should be extremely careful about what de does. It is the social responsibility of that man to live up to a high standard of moral and spiritual conduct.\nIndividually a man may be a Jnani. He may not be bound by any kind of action. But so long as he is in an embodied state, his outer life should be perfectly befitting the injunctions of the Sastras.\nGenerally, when one comes across a realised saint, he regards him as the standard of excellence, as an example and demonstration of Sastric law in actual life. Thus he has a social responsibility to show the right way to the masses by following the Sastras.\nWhat the great people and leaders do, is copied by the common man. Yatha raja tatha praja. That is the popular saying of the elders. Arjuna was a prominent figure at that time. People looked up to him with admiration. So the Lord instructs him to act, to carry out the injunctions of the Sastras, to perform the duty prescribed by the standard in life, to fight the battle as a Kshatriya ought to do, and thus set an example of Nishkama Karma. If he fails to stand up to the law, he would confuse and corrupt the minds of the people and they would lose both the material and spiritual realms. They would become inactive, lazy and by self-delusion, they may become hypocrites pretending to have Jnana which they do not really possess.\nThe principles, doctrines, and laws which the elders accept and follow form the code of conduct for the masses. So the elders of the community should make it a rule to follow the truth, to follow the sastras, to live nobly, to shed the light of the spirit all around, to be the beacons and guide-posts for all people in their journey through life. The Lord exhorts Arjuna to set a great example of righteous action for the people.\nThe Lord insists on practice and not mere talk. Anyone can talk high philosophy, but very few people are able to mould their life according to the truths of spirituality. The master should live the life according to Atma Dharma, and show the world how such life should be lived. It is only then that the people could cultivate faith in God and the laws of the Sastras.\nBhagavad Gita 3.21 by Swami Sarvapriyananda\nBhagavad Gita 3.20 and 3.21 by Swami Sarvapriyananda\nSwami Vivekananda Says —\n“Even if you have known the secret that you have no duty, that you are free, still you have to work for the good of others. Because whatever a great man does, ordinary people will do also.”\n[Source]\nSri Ramakrishna Says —\n“The sannyasi must observe very strict discipline. He must not look even at the picture of a woman. But this rule doesn’t apply to householders. An aspirant should not associate with a woman, even though she is very much devoted to God. A sannyasi, even though he may have subdued his passions, should follow this discipline to set an example to householders.\n“Worldly people learn renunciation by seeing the complete renunciation of a monk; otherwise they sink more and more. A sannyasi is a world teacher.” (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\n—–\n“But it is extremely harmful for a sannyasi. He must not look even at the portrait of a woman. A monk enjoying a woman is like a man swallowing the spittle he has already spat out. A sannyasi must not sit near a woman and talk to her, even if she is intensely pious. No, he must not talk to a woman even though he may have controlled his passion.\n“A sannyasi must renounce both ‘woman’ and ‘gold’. As he must not look even at the portrait of a woman, so also he must not touch gold, that is to say, money. It is bad for him even to keep money near him, for it brings in its train calculation, worry, insolence, anger, and such evils. There is an instance in the sun: it shines brightly; suddenly a cloud appears and hides it.\n“That is why I didn’t agree to the Marwari’s depositing money for me with Hriday. I said: ‘No, I won’t allow even that. If I keep money near me, it will certainly raise clouds.’\n“Why all these strict rules for a sannyasi? It is for the welfare of mankind as well as for his own good. A sannyasi may himself lead an unattached life and may have controlled his passion, but he must renounce ‘woman and gold’ to set an example to the world.\n“A man will have the courage to practise renunciation if he sees one hundred per cent renunciation in a sannyasi. Then only will he try to give up ‘woman and gold’. If a sannyasi does not set this example, then who will?

He is everything, and yet out of compassion for humanity, He incarnates Himself, again and again, to maintain Dharma for the well-being and progress of the world. He is ceaselessly working everywhere for establishing Dharma. He, the infinite formless Brahman, takes birth, comes into the world, mingles with men, teaches them, elevates them, and leads them on to freedom and bliss. If the Lord Himself is thus engaged in work, should not the common man work for his own good? The great Jivanmuktas like Buddha, Shankara, and a long line of sages and prophets have all done tremendous work in the World. Why? Not for their own gain, because they have nothing to gain, but for the sake of humanity. So the seekers and aspirants should do honest and sincere work to purify themselves and attain the spiritual aim. They should not be inactive, because inaction is tamas. Work, work, is the Lord’s command. Work without attachment, performing one’s duty unmindful of the results, is the law of karma yoga.\nBhagavad Gita 3.22 by Swami Sarvapriyananda\nSwami Vivekananda Says —\nOur best work is done, our greatest influence is exerted, when we are without thought of self. All great geniuses know this. Let us open ourselves to the one Divine Actor, and let Him act, and do nothing ourselves. “O Arjuna! I have no duty in the whole world”, says Krishna. Be perfectly resigned, perfectly unconcerned; then alone can you do any true work. No eyes can see the real forces, we can only see the results. Put out self, lose it, forget it; just let God work, it is His business. We have nothing to do but stand aside and let God work. The more we go away, the more God comes in. Get rid of the little “I”, and let only the great “I” live.\n[Source]",

History has recorded the lives of many of the leaders, and the way how they worked till the last breath of their life for a righteous cause.\nMoreover, the word\natandritah\n(without relaxation) implies that the seekers and aspirants should be alert and watchful in the sadhana. If the Lord who is eternally free and perfect is so alert and watchful in performing his duty, how much more so should the common man be in his discipline to free himself from the shackles of Samsara. However intelligent one may be, if he is not vigilant, he is easily knocked out of his path by Maya. The senses are so powerful as to draw away the mind from the spiritual idea. Night and day, at all times, under all circumstances, vigilance is necessary to preserve the mind from lapsing into dullness and sense-pleasures. Discrimination between the real and the unreal, God’s grace, ceaseless effort are all necessary for spiritual progress. How much care is needed for the driver of an Express Train in the night! Could he afford to be negligent? How many lives depend on his care and caution? Even so, the seeker has to be continuously vigilant and active in his practices. The human machine is sure to be damaged if he is negligent and a breakdown is certain.\nAlways\n: The lord is always alert in the performance of his duty for the welfare of mankind. The Sastras say – ‘negligence is death (\nPramado vai mrityuh\n)’.\nNegligence regarding the awareness of Brahman should not be at any time. Such forgetfulness of Atma is death – so says Sanatkumara. The seeker should therefore remember the keyword\nalert (atandritah)\nand always be wakeful in his contemplation of the Self.",

    "translation": "These worlds would perish if I do not perform work; I would be the cause of the confusion of species and the destruction of these beings.",
    "commentary": "If I do not work, these worlds would perish. People would not work. Consequently, there would be confusion in all fields of life. Peace would not be there. People would become unrighteous and sinful. As a result, natural calamities would overtake them. I would be the author and cause of the destruction of beings. So, for the protection and welfare of all the worlds, I work. Thus the Lord proves the need for the discipline of karma yoga in the world.\nThe Lord is the cosmic intelligence who gives the law for the orderly evolution of the Universe. The plan of the Universe and its orderly functioning is due to the will of the Lord. Let us imagine what would happen to mankind on the globe if the laws of the universe are relaxed for a brief while. The whole world would crash into destruction. The pride of human intelligence appears childish when one contemplates the beneficent power that keeps the planets in their orbits. So the Lord says that if he does not work the world would perish.\nThe same law applies to the various duties and functions of man for the orderly maintenance and progress of humanity. The violation of this law would lead to confusion of duties and functions The Lord expects every man to keep the law by the performance of the duties in the scheme of the world. By doing so, the community as a whole would grow and prosper. Karma Yoga, besides being the path of self-purification and Self-realisation, is the divine technic to secure peace and prosperity for mankind in this earthly life.\nBhagavad Gita 3.24 by Swami Sarvapriyananda\nSwami Vivekananda Says —\nWork day and night! “Behold, I am the Lord of the Universe. I have no duty. Every duty is bondage. But I work for work’s sake. If I ceased to work for a minute, [there would be chaos].” So do thou work, without any idea of duty.\n[Source]\nKrishna says, “Look at Me, Arjuna! If I stop from work for one moment, the whole universe will die. I have nothing to gain from work; I am the one Lord, but why do I work? Because I love the world.” God is unattached because He loves; that real love makes us unattached.\n[Source]\nIf a great man who has attained peace of mind and freedom ceases to work, then all the rest without that knowledge and peace will try to imitate him, and thus confusion would arise. “Behold, Arjuna, there is nothing that I do not possess and nothing that I want to acquire. And yet I continue to work. If I stopped work for a moment, the whole universe would [be destroyed].”\n[Source]\nThe first is the question of creation, that this nature, Prakriti, Maya is infinite, without beginning. It is not that this world was created the other day, not that a God came and created the world and since that time has been sleeping; for that cannot be. The creative energy is still going on. God is eternally creating — is never at rest. Remember the passage in the Gita where Krishna says, “If I remain at rest for one moment, this universe will be destroyed.” If that creative energy which is working all around us, day and night, stops for a second, the whole thing falls to the ground. There never was a time when that energy did not work throughout the universe, but there is the law of cycles, pralaya.\n[Source]\nThus the vital point of our national life has been touched; otherwise, why should we sink to this degraded state? Read in the Gita, “सङ्करस्य च कर्ता स्यामुपहन्यामिमा: प्रजा: — I should then be the cause of the admixture of races, and I should thus ruin these beings.” How came this terrible varna-samkarya — this confounding mixture of all castes — and disappearance of all qualitative distinctions? Why has the white complexion of our forefathers now become black? Why did the sattva-guna give place to the prevailing tamas with a sprinkling, as it were, of rajas in it? That is a long story to tell, and I reserve my answer for some future occasion. For the present, try to understand this, that if the jati dharma (*) be rightly and truly preserved, the nation shall never fall.\n[Source]\n*\nJati dharma\n, that is, the dharma enjoined according to the different castes — the svadharma, that is, one’s own dharma, or set of duties prescribed for man according to his capacity and position — which is the very basis of Vedic religion and Vedic society.",

    "translation": "O Arjuna! As the ignorant men work with attachment to action, so should the wise act without attachment, for the welfare of the world.",
    "commentary": "According to\nSwami Ranganathananda\n, 13th president of the Ramakrishna Math and Mission, this is the most important verse of the Bhagavad Gita. (Narrated by Swami Shuddhidananda in the audio below.)\nThe wise and the ignorant both perform work. But there is a clear difference in attitude between the two. The wise act without attachment to the fruits of work. The ignorant act with attachment to the fruits of work. The wise are not entangled in work because they have no sense of doership. The ignorant are caught in the meshes of work by thinking that they are the doers. The wise work for the welfare of the world. The ignorant work for their own satisfaction.\nWork is common to both. But what a world of difference in purpose and spirit.\nTherefore the wise attain liberation through work and the ignorant are bound to the wheel of birth and death. Work is like a sword. For one who knows how to use it, it is a good instrument of action; for another, it is a deadly weapon of self-destruction. The wise use fire for useful purposes, the ignorant get themselves burned by it. This being so, it is essential that the seeker should understand the secret of right action, it method, attitude, and aim.\nThe Lord says, “Do not be inactive. Use this great instrument of action (karma) for Self-realisation. Know how you should work and with what aim.” He explains the method here. The principle of work is detachment. Work should be done without desire for the personal enjoyment of the fruits thereof, and unmindful of success or failure.\nThe common man is constantly at work, earning money with zeal and enthusiasm, building houses, purchasing lands, securing for himself and his family all the material pleasures of life. Besides, he thinks that he is the doer of all this work. But the impersonal attitude to work is Karma yoga. The wise people work with equal zeal and enthusiasm, but they know that they are only the instruments of the Lord in the service of humanity. Acting in this spirit, they attain liberation.\nWelfare of the world:\nWe understand from these words that the Lord values service to humanity and other beings. It is the duty of all seekers to do what is most pleasing to the Lord. In this service, work is worship of the Lord. Any little help and service done to fellow beings is accepted by Him as an act of devotion to Him.",

    "translation": "The wise man should not disturb and confuse the minds of the ignorant attached to action. By performing all actions with yogic equanimity, they should make the ignorant do accordingly.",
    "commentary": "The Lord continues to lay stress on the duty of the wise to lead the people on the right path by personal demonstration of karma yoga.\nThe Jnani, though he is individually free from all action and work, should not disturb and confuse the minds of the people by abstract doctrines and theories. He should set the example by his personal life. It is only then that people could understand the secret of Karma yoga. The world is action; life is action; people are acting in a variety of ways; the whole of nature is in ceaseless motion. The realised sage may understand the state of absolute stillness in the Supreme Being, but for all others, it is a theory that they do not comprehend. Several people who are religiously-minded are doing worship with some faith in God in the hope of gaining some worldly good. The poor man worships God to attain some property. The sick man worships God to be relieved of pain and suffering. The house-holder beset with a thousand difficulties all around worships God to overcome the troubles of life. All this is sakama karma. But it would be foolish to tell them that what they are doing is wrong.\nSuch verbal teaching makes no meaning to them. It might confuse their minds and some of them may give up action, thinking that it is the right path.\nSo the wise man should be careful that his teaching does not run counter to the law of nature and human disposition.\nHe should remain steadfast in the Atmic state, work without attachment, be equal-minded under all circumstances, and emanate peace and blessedness all around him. Thus the people would see and understand how they should live and work. It is not theory. It is the direct personal example the lord wants the wise man (Vidvan) to present before the people.\nAnyone with a little learning of religious theory can make impressive speeches from the public platform. People may admire his eloquence and flowery flow of language. But it does not enlighten the people. Anything could be affirmed or denied by subtle argument. This leads nowhere. Instead of clarifying the position, it makes confusion worse confounded. But real solid experience and practical living needs no argument to prove the efficacy of religious realisation. When we come across a realised one who emanates peace and blessedness by his very presence, all doubts come to rest and the seeker experiences a state of mind which is an affirmation of spiritual Truth. No more argumentation, speculation, theories and dogmas, and doubts. They are all gone, and people would come to know what life in the Spirit is and how to live it. That is what the Lord expects the wise man to do.\nDoing with equanimity:\nThe Lord’s command is that the wise man, established in the Self, should perform work with equanimity and by his detachment, purity, and peace show the way to all.\nBhagavad Gita 3.26 by Swami Sarvapriyananda\nSwami Vivekananda Says —\nQ. — Are sects, ceremonies, and scriptures helps to realization?\nA. — When a man realizes, he gives up everything. The various sects and ceremonies and books, so far as they are the means of arriving at that point, are all right. But when they fail in that, we must change them. “The knowing one must not despise the condition of those who are ignorant, nor should the knowing one destroy the faith of the ignorant in their own particular method, but by proper action lead them and show them the path to come to where he stands.”\n[Source]\nDo not try to disturb the faith of any man. If you can, give him something better; if you can, get hold of a man where he stands and give him a push upwards; do so, but do not destroy what he has. The only true teacher is he who can convert himself, as it were, into a thousand persons at a moment’s notice. The only true teacher is he who can immediately come down to the level of the student, and transfer his soul to the student’s soul and see through the student’s eyes and hear through his ears and understand through his mind. Such a teacher can really teach and none else. All these negative, breaking-down, destructive teachers that are in the world can never do any good.\n[Source]\nSpeak out the truth boldly, without any fear that it will puzzle the weak. Men are selfish; they do not want others to come up to the same level of their knowledge, for fear of losing their own privilege and prestige over others. Their contention is that the knowledge of the highest spiritual truths will bring about confusion in the understanding of the weak-minded men, and so the shloka goes: “One should not unsettle the understanding of the ignorant, attached to action (by teaching them jnana): the wise man, himself steadily acting, should engage the ignorant in all work.”\n[Source]\nWhat right have you to say that this man’s method is wrong? It may be wrong for you. That is to say, if you undertake the method, you will be degraded; but that does not mean that he will be degraded. Therefore, says Krishna, if you have knowledge and see a man weak, do not condemn him. Go to his level and help him if you can. He must grow.\n[Source]\nEven if you have knowledge, do not disturb the childlike faith of the ignorant. On the other hand, go down to their level and gradually bring them up. That is a very powerful idea, and it has become the ideal in India. That is why you can see a great philosopher going into a temple and worshipping images. It is not hypocrisy.\n[Source]\nSri Ramakrishna Says —\nOne should not discuss the discipline of the Impersonal God or the path of knowledge with a bhakta. Through great effort perhaps he is just cultivating a little devotion. You will injure it if you explain away everything as a mere dream. (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\nIf the spiritual life is intensified, the outer life will adjust itself automatically; this principle applies equally to the life of an organization.\n— Swami Brahmananda\nBe the change you wish to see in the world.\n—\nMahatma Gandhi",

    "translation": "By the qualities of nature, actions are performed in all cases, but one whose mind is deluded by egoism thinks “I am the doer”.",
    "commentary": "The Lord explains how the action takes place. Action takes place by the power of the qualities of nature. Those qualities are – Satva, Rajas, and Tamas. They are called the three Gunas. These qualities of nature are modified into the four elements –\nmanas, buddhi, chitta, ahamkara\n, the five subtle elements, the five organs of action, the five organs of perception, and the five objects of the senses. Thus the human organism and the universe around are the product of Nature. All actions wherever and in whatever manner they take place are actually done by the power of the three gunas. Atma remains as the eternal uncontaminated witness. The real man is Atma. It is the witness of the body, the internal and external organs, and the modifications of the mind. In truth, the real man is not the doer. All the actions that man apparently performs with his physical and subtle organs is the work of Nature, and not of the man himself in his real Being. But the deluded man having identified himself with the body thinks “I am the doer,” and so thinking he burdens himself with the responsibility for all of them. Consequently, he has to pass through several births and suffer endless pain and sorrow.\nThis is exactly the difference between the wise and the ignorant. The ignorant man imagines himself to be the body and thinks that he is the doer, enjoyer of all actions and the fruits thereof. The wise man seprates himself from the vehicle of the body and knows that he is the Self, that he is not the doer nor is he subject to the binding power of his actions.\nJoy and sorrow depend upon the idea of doership. If you think you are the body, you have to bear pain and grief and all the innumerable ills of life. If you think you are the Self, you are at the source of all bliss. So let the seeker discriminate between the Self and the non-Self, and know his real nature. Then all that he does is sublimated into the Self and remains unaffected.\nThe secret of Karma Yoga is to understand the law how actions are performed and with what power they are performed. The Lord makes it clear that the cause of action is Nature functioning through the three gunas.\nOne whose mind is deluded by egoism:\nThe ignorant man is deluded by his ego and considers that he is doing this and that and all the thousand actions of bodily life. Identification with the body “Dehatma Buddhi” is the root cause of delusion. Such a man is called Vimudhatma. The wise man knows that he is the blissful and blessed Brahman.\nBhagavad Gita 3.27 by Swami Sarvapriyananda\nBhagavad Gita 3.27 Additional by Swami Sarvapriyananda\nSwami Vivekananda Says —\n“Therefore, Arjuna, all these actions are in nature. Nature … is working out her own laws in our bodies and minds. We identify ourselves with nature and say, ‘I am doing this.’ This way delusion seizes us.” We always act under some compulsion. When hunger compels me, I eat. And suffering is still worse — slavery. That real “I” is eternally free. What can compel it to do anything? The sufferer is in nature. It is only when we identify ourselves with the body that we say, “I am suffering; I am Mr. So-and-so” — all such nonsense. But he who has known the truth, holds himself aloof. Whatever his body does, whatever his mind does, he does not care. But mind you, the vast majority of mankind are under this delusion; and whenever they do any good, they feel that they are [the doers].\n[Source]\nSri Ramakrishna Says —\n“\nDo you know my attitude? As for myself, I eat, drink, and live happily. The rest the Divine Mother knows.\nIndeed, there are three words that prick my flesh: ‘guru’, ‘master’, and ‘father’.\n“There is only one Guru, and that is Satchidananda. He alone is the Teacher. My attitude toward God is that of a child toward its mother. One can get human gurus by the million. All want to be teachers. But who cares to be a disciple?\n“It is extremely difficult to teach others. A man can teach only if God reveals Himself to him and gives the command. Narada, Sukadeva, and sages like them had such a command from God, and Sankara had it too. Unless you have a command from God, who will listen to your words? …..\n“God does reveal Himself to man and speak. Only then may one receive His command. How forceful are the words of such a teacher! They can move mountains. But mere lectures? People will listen to them for a few days and then forget them. They will never act upon mere words.\n“At Kamarpukur there is a small lake called the Haldarpukur. Certain people used to befoul its banks every day. Others who came there in the morning to bathe would abuse the offenders loudly. But next morning they would find the same thing. The nuisance didn’t stop. (\nAll laugh\n.) The villagers finally informed the authorities about it. A constable was sent, who put up a notice on the bank which read: ‘Commit no nuisance.’ This stopped the miscreants at once. (\nAll laugh\n.)\n“To teach others, one must have a badge of authority; otherwise teaching becomes a mockery. A man who is himself ignorant starts out to teach others — like the blind leading the blind! Instead of doing good, such , teaching does harm. After the realisation of God one obtains an inner vision. Only then can one diagnose a person’s spiritual malady and give instruction.\n“Without the commission from God, a man becomes vain. He says to himself, ‘I am teaching people.’ This vanity comes from ignorance, for only an ignorant person feels that he is the doer. A man verily becomes liberated in life if he feels: ‘God is the Doer. He alone is doing everything. I am doing nothing.’ Man’s sufferings and worries spring only from his persistent thought that he is the doer. (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\n—–\nVIJAY:\n“Sir, why are we bound like this? Why don’t we see God?”\nMASTER:\n“Maya is nothing but the egotism of the embodied soul. This egotism has covered everything like a veil. ‘All troubles come to an end when the ego dies.’ If by the grace of God a man but once realises that he is not the doer, then he at once becomes a jivanmukta. Though living in the body, he is liberated. He has nothing else to fear.\n“This maya, that is to say, the ego, is like a cloud. The sun cannot be seen on account of a thin patch of cloud; when that disappears one sees the sun. If by the grace of the guru one’s ego vanishes, then one sees God.\n“Rama, who is God Himself, was only two and a half cubits ahead of Lakshmana. But Lakshmana couldn’t see Him because Sita stood between them. Lakshmana may be compared to the jiva, and Sita to maya. Man cannot see God on account of the barrier of maya. Just look: I am creating a barrier in front of my face with this towel. Now you can’t see me, even though I am so near. Likewise, God is the nearest of all, but we cannot see Him on account of this covering of maya.\n“\nThe jiva is nothing but the embodiment of Satchidananda. But since maya, or ego, has created various upadhis, he has forgotten his real Self.\n“Each upadhi changes man’s nature. If he wears a fine black-bordered cloth, you will at once find him humming Nidhu Babu’s love-songs. Then playing-cards and a walking-stick follow. If even a sickly man puts on high boots, he begins to whistle and climbs the stairs like an Englishman, jumping from one step to another. If a man but holds a pen in his hand, he scribbles on any paper he can get hold of — such is the power of the pen!\n“Money is also a great upadhi. The possession of money makes such a difference in a man! He is no longer the same person. ……\n“A frog had a rupee, which he kept in his hole. One day an elephant was going over the hole, and the frog, coming out in a fit of anger, raised his foot, as if to kick the elephant, and said, ‘How dare you walk over my head?’ Such is the pride that money begets!\n“One can get rid of the ego after the attainment of Knowledge. On attaining Knowledge one goes into samadhi, and the ego disappears. But it is very difficult to obtain such Knowledge. ……\n“Once a salt doll went to measure the depth of the ocean. No sooner did it enter the water than it melted. Now who could tell how deep the ocean was? That which could have told about its depth had melted. Reaching the seventh plane, the mind is annihilated; man goes into samadhi. What he feels then cannot be described in words. ……\n“It is true that one or two can get rid of the ‘I’ through samadhi; but these cases are very rare. You may indulge in thousands of reasonings, but still the ‘I’ comes back. You may cut the peepal-tree to the very root today, but you will notice a sprout springing up tomorrow. Therefore if the ‘I’ must remain, let the rascal remain as the ‘servant I’. As long as you live, you should say, ‘O God, Thou art the Master and I am Thy servant.’ The ‘I’ that feels, ‘I am the servant of God, I am His devotee’ does not injure one. Sweet things cause acidity of the stomach, no doubt, but sugar candy is an exception.\n“The path of knowledge is very difficult. One cannot obtain Knowledge unless one gets rid of the feeling that one is the body. In the Kaliyuga the life of man is centred on food. He cannot get rid of the feeling that he is the body. and the ego. Therefore the path of devotion is prescribed for this cycle. This is an easy path. You will attain God if you sing His name and glories and pray to Him with a longing heart. There is not the least doubt about it.\n“Suppose you draw a line on the surface of water with a bamboo stick. The water appears to be divided into two parts; but the line doesn’t remain for any length of time. The ‘servant I’ or the ‘devotee I’ or the ‘child I’ is only a line drawn with the ego and is not real.” (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\n—–\n“A man thinks, ‘I have practised a little prayer and austerity; so I have gained a victory over others.’ But victory and defeat lie with God. I have seen a prostitute dying in the Ganges and retaining consciousness\n1\nto the end.” (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\n—–\n“A man becomes liberated even in this life when he knows that God is the Doer of all things. Once Keshab came here with Sambhu Mallick. I said to him, ‘Not even a leaf moves except by the will of God.’ Where is man’s free will? All are under the will of God. Nangta was a man of great knowledge, yet even he was about to drown himself in the Ganges. He stayed here eleven months. At one time he suffered from stomach trouble. The excruciating pain made him lose control over himself, and he wanted to drown himself in the river. There was a long shoal near the bathing-ghat. However far he went into the river, he couldn’t find water above his knees. Then he understood everything (He realised that man is not free even to kill himself, that everything depends on the will of the Divine Mother.\nSee\n) and came back. At one time I was very ill and was about to cut my throat with a knife. Therefore I say: ‘O Mother, I am the machine and Thou art the Operator; I am the chariot and Thou art the Driver. I move as Thou movest me; I do as Thou makest me do.'” (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\nRelated Articles:\n“That yaksha was Brahman,” said She. “It was through the victory of Brahman, indeed, that you achieved this glory.” It was from that (from the words of Umā) that he (Indra) understood that the yaksha was Brahman. (\nKena Upanishad 4.1\n)\nThe Lord, Isa, supports all this which has been joined together-the perishable and the imperishable, the manifest, the effect and the unmanifest, the cause. The same Lord, the Supreme Self, devoid of Lordship, becomes bound because of assuming the attitude of the enjoyer. The jiva again realizes the Supreme Self and is freed from all fetters.

He who knows how to separate them is the knower of Truth.\nAs the holy grass is separated from the blades, as grain is separated from the chaff, the Self should be separated from the non-Self, and the spirit should be separated from matter. Having thus separated the two by the power of his discriminative understanding, the man of knowledge looks upon all modifications in himself and the universe as only the functions of nature with which he is not concerned. So he remains completely detached from his own senses and mind and the world around him. He is uncontaminated by anything physical and material. He is like the water-drop on the lotus-leaf.\nHow can the self-realised man have any attraction for the world which is insentient and unreal as a dream? As churned butter will not mix with butter-milk but floats on it, so also the knower of truth, who lives the Self, is not burdened with the tremendous weight of the objective world. He has thus no concern at all with the pleasures and pains caused and suffered by Nature. Detachment from the modifications of Nature is emancipation. Patanjali says –\n“The intermingling of the seer And the seen should be given up.” The ignorant man who has not purified his discriminative understanding is plunged into `Samsara’ because he thinks that he is the body, that he is undergoing all the changes of the body, mind, and senses, and that he is acting and reacting. So the seeker should gradually develop his contact with Atma, leaving off his former attachment for the body.\nBhagavad Gita 3.28 by Swami Sarvapriyananda",

    "translation": "The man of knowledge should not confuse the mind of those men of imperfect understanding who, deluded by the Gunas of Nature, are attached to action in the material world.",
    "commentary": "In the\ntwenty-sixth verse of this Discourse\n, the Lord warned the man of knowledge not to confuse the mind of the ignorant by theoretical speculations, but to show the right way by acting in the right spirit. The same idea is repeated here. The ignorant who form the majority are attached to the body and consider the qualities of Nature as their own.\nSpontaneously they think that they are working and acting with the definite object of enjoyment of the fruits of work. Such people should not be confused by theorising about the actionlessness of Brahman, which they cannot easily understand. So the wise man (\nVidvan, tatvavit\n) should show the way by himself acting without attachment, and acting always on the highest principles of righteousness. The wise have to shoulder a tremendous responsibility. His life should conform to the pattern enjoined by the Sastras, though he is himself beyond all laws, rules, and regulations.\nOf imperfect understanding:\nThose who are attached to the body, mind, and senses, are men of imperfect knowledge. Worldly wisdom, knowledge of Sastras, learning, capacity to interpret the scripture, oratorical powers – all these and more do not qualify a man to be entitled a man of knowledge if he identifies himself with them. This identity with the body should be given up and union with the Self should be established.\nMan of perfect knowledge:\nPerfection of knowledge consists in realising the Self, knowing which man knows everything.\nThe sages of yore directed their enquiring not so much to the objective world outside but to discover in themselves the secret of their being. They discovered the all-pervading Atma, and were satisfied because they realised that the whole universe is Atma and nothing else is the material and efficient cause of all that exists. They have thus become free from the delusion of the limited ego. They have become the possessors of perfect knowledge, bliss and blessedness. This should be the aim and goal of every seeker who is eager to know the Truth in the midst of the thousand and one ills and shocks of mortal life. This is the only way to peace.\nBhagavad Gita 3.29 by Swami Sarvapriyananda\nBhagavad Gita 3.28 and 3.29 by Swami Sarvapriyananda\nGIRISH (\nwith a smile\n):\n“I defeated Narendra in the argument.”\nMASTER:\n“Oh, no!

It is not proper to meddle with such faith.'” (\nBG 3.26\n,\nBG 3.29\n) (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)",

    "translation": "Renouncing all actions in Me with the mind fixed in Self, free from hope and egoism, fight without mental agitation.",
    "commentary": "Most people’s minds are filled with worldly knowledge and objective considerations. Such troubled minds cannot reflect the light of\nParamatma\n. It is not a spiritual mind. It is the gross mind capable of apprehending only material things. The aspirant should cultivate a spiritualised mind, illumined by knowledge and devoted to the Lord. Such is the purified mind capable of apprehending the subtle Reality underlying all matter. With the mind thus spiritualised, man should surrender all actions and their fruits to God. All actions without exception should be surrendered. That is the Lord’s command.\nFree from desire and egoism:\nDesire and egoism (personal selfishness) should be given up. Man should understand that there is only one Reality. God (Atma) is the universe. Knowing this man cannot have any attachment of I and Mine to anything in the world. He knows that the world is only a reflection and dreamlike projection of the mind, which is subject to change, growth and decay. Thus freeing himself from the burden of material things, man should surrender to the Lord and carry out the duties of life in a detached manner. Since Arjuna is a Kshatriya the Lord’s injunction to him is ‘fight’. It means that\nevery individual, according to his position in the social structure should execute his duty prescribed by custom and tradition in a spirit of dedication to the Lord-the Supreme Being.\nWithout passion:\n“Fight, free from passion” – that is again the Lord’s command. The fever of life is of two kinds. One affects the body, another attacks the mind. The first could be cured by medicine. But the internal fever of the mind, being more subtle, requires a spiritual cure. Every man runs to a Doctor at the slightest touch of physical ill-health, but is he taking the same care of the mind and its fever? No. The fire and passion expressing itself in anger and hatred, which consume the internal man, can be cured and extinguished only by spiritual knowledge.\nTo divert to God, to surrender the fruits of work to God, to give up all foolish desires, to have no feeling of I and Mine – these are steps to be taken by the seeker. These four aspects of spiritual discipline constitute the most powerful cure for life’s fitful fever.\nIt should be understood that the Lord insists on action and surrender. The terms ‘fight’ (Yuahyasva) and renouncing (Samnyasya) may appear apparently contrary, but it is not really so. If a wood-cutter or soldier or teacher or politician should realise the Truth, he should not for that reason change himself or something else in the social structure. He would still be a wood-cutter or a teacher etc., and would be performing all the duties that belong to his profession. Only he knows that it is not the same person who is doing the work. The Kshatriya continues to fight the enemy and defend his country, but he knows that he is not the same person who is doing the work. Thus the concept of Hinduism is not a negation of action, but a proper understanding of the feeling of action which enables the actor to act without passion, without elation of hope or the frustration of failure. Every man should surrender everything to the Lord and carry on the duties of life cheerfully and with courage.\nBhagavad Gita 3.30 by Swami Sarvapriyananda\nBhagavad Gita 3.30 Additional by Swami Sarvapriyananda\nSwami Vivekananda Says —\n“Surrendering the fruits of work to God” is to take to ourselves neither credit nor blame, but to give up both to the Lord and be at peace.\n[Source]\nThe Gita teaches that all works should be done thus. He who is one with the Lord through yoga performs all his works by becoming immersed in concentration, and does not seek any personal benefit. Such a performance of work brings only good to the world, no evil can come out of it. Those who work thus never do anything for themselves.\n[Source]\nSri Ramakrishna Says —\nMASTER (\nto Pratap\n):\n“It is not in England alone that one sees attachment to worldly things. You see it everywhere. But remember that work is only the first step in spiritual life. God cannot be realised without sattva — love, discrimination, kindness, and so on. It is the very nature of rajas to involve a man in many worldly activities. That is why rajas degenerates into tamas. If a man is entangled in too many activities he surely forgets God. He becomes more and more attached to ‘woman and gold’.\n“\nBut it is not possible for you to give up work altogether. Your very nature will lead you to it whether you like it or not. Therefore the scriptures ask you to work in a detached spirit, that is to say, not to crave the work’s results.\n(\nBG 18.59\n) For example, you may perform devotions and worship, and practise austerities,\nbut your aim is not to earn people’s recognition or to increase your merit.\n“To work in such a spirit of detachment is known as karmayoga. But it is very difficult. We are living in the Kaliyuga, when one easily becomes attached to one’s actions. You may think you are working in a detached spirit, but attachment creeps into the mind from nobody knows where. You may worship in the temple or arrange a grand religious festival or feed many poor and starving people. You may think you have done all this without hankering after the results. But unknown to yourself the desire for name and fame has somehow crept into your mind. Complete detachment from the results of action is possible only for one who has seen God.”\nA DEVOTEE:\n“Then what is the way for those who have not seen God? Must they give up all the duties of the world?”\nMASTER:\n“The best path for this age is bhaktiyoga, the path of bhakti prescribed by Narada: to sing the name and glories of God and pray to Him with a longing heart, “O God, give me knowledge, give me devotion, and reveal Thyself to me!’ The path of karma is extremely difficult. Therefore one should pray: ‘O God, make my duties fewer and fewer; and may I, through Thy grace, do the few duties that Thou givest me without any attachment to their results! May I have no desire to be involved in many activities!’\n“It is not possible to give up work altogether. Even to think or to meditate is a kind of work.\nAs you develop love for God, your worldly activities become fewer and fewer of themselves.\nAnd you lose all interest in them. Can one who has tasted a drink made of sugar candy enjoy a drink made of ordinary molasses?”\nA DEVOTEE:\n“The English people always exhort us to be active. Isn’t action the aim of life then?”\nMASTER:\n“The aim of life is the attainment of God. Work is only a preliminary step; it can never be the end. Even unselfish work is only a means; it is not the end.\n(Source: Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna)\nRelated Articles:\nNo one can live even for a moment without doing work. Everyone without his will is made to do work by the qualities born of Prakriti. (\nBG 3.5\n)",

    "translation": "In each of the senses abide attraction and repulsion for the objects of the senses. One should not come under their sway, for they are man’s enemies.",
    "commentary": "Here is the Lord’s command about restraining the senses and conquering Nature. It would be wrong to interpret from the previous verse that the Lord was stating the impossibility of overcoming Nature. Man should not come under the sway of the material forces operating in the human personality. That is the Lord’s injunction.\nSo the whole progress of spiritual life is one continuous and systematic attempt to counteract the natural forces till they are completely subdued.\nAll the different paths, methods, practices and disciplines have only one end in view, and that is the\nconquest of Nature in all its subtle forms and manifestations.\nEach of the five senses has a double current running in opposite directions. When the object is pleasing, it is delighted; when the object is disagreeable, it is pained: Attachment and repulsion are formed. So when the senses come into contact with the multifarious objects of the world, it is sometimes attached to them, and sometimes repulsed from them. The same object may be pleasing sometimes and under changed conditions may cause pain. These reactions of the senses are termed ‘raga’ and `dvesha’ . These are inherent in the sense-world. The entire spiritual discipline is to attain to a state of non-reaction or equal reaction to all the objects of the world under all conditions, whether they are agreeable or disagreeable. One who has acquired such equanimity is a Yogi, a\nSthitaprajna\n.\nAttachment and repulsion (Raga and Dvesha) are the eternal enemies of the spiritual aspirant. These pairs of opposites have long-established their sway on the mind and the senses. And when man, by an enlightened consciousness, tries to equalise the reactions, the mind and the senses would stoutly refuse to submit to the new discipline. Thoughts and habits react. The aspirant has to remain firm and unyielding, and only then would he be able to stamp his will and attain mastery over the opposing forces. Devotion to God, selfless work, meditation on the real Self, grace of a Guru, are helpers to secure victory. Till then there is no rest or peace for man.\nWhen enemies enter a village they are dangerous, when they enter the house, they are still more dangerous; and when they find a place in one’s own heart, the danger is greatest.\nRaga and Dvesha are internal enemies. “Do not fall under their sway” is the Lord’s command.\nThe internal reactions of each individual are determined by the accumulated force of several births. They are deep-rooted and well-established in the heart of man. The aspirant brings in his discrimination as the resisting power. The struggle goes on for a long time. That which is stronger wins. It is futile to lament about the persistence of past tendencies (samskaras). They are there, whether you want them or not. Cheerfully and with courage one has to fight them. The Lord’s grace is on the side of the faithful aspirant. Nothing is impossible for him. Such should be the indomitable faith of the devotee, and\nthe Lord’s promise not to let down his devote should give the aspirant the necessary will and inspiration, strength and courage to fight the battle till victory is achieved.\nBhagavad Gita 3.34 by Swami Sarvapriyananda",

To neglect his duty and adopt the duty of another is dangerous because it would upset the order of the world, and create confusion and chaos in society. In the First Discourse, Arjuna spoke in a mood of despondency that he would prefer to live on alms like a mendicant than kill his relations and friends in battle. The Lord here states the law for a Kshatriya and the danger of neglecting it and adopting the life of another.\nThe word Svadharmah may be taken to mean the law of the Self and paradharma may mean the law of the objective world (i.e.) the pleasure of the senses and the physical body. Whatever is conducive to Self-realisation should be followed, even it causes death in the attempt. Whatever draws away from Atma-dhrama should be avoided. Fasting, penance and other sadhanas though irksome in the beginning confer great merit finally. They constitute Atma-dhrama. On the other hand worldly pleasures though enjoyable at first, lead to pain and suffering. So the seeker should hold on to the Self and go on practicing the prescribed duties. Sometimes the seeker may feel that he is not making any progress and that his sadhana is futile. In these moments of doubt, the seeker should be cautious and firm. He should not abandon his practices. If he dies in the midst of his Yoga-Sadhana, he does not perish. He attains to higher world and would come to act again into the human body to continue his work. So the Lord exhorts the seeker not to give up Svadharma, Atma-dhrama under any circumstances.\nBhagavad Gita 3.35 by Swami Sarvapriyananda\nSwami Vivekananda Says —\nShri Krishna says: “Better die in your own path than attempt the path of another.” This is my path, and I am down here. And you are way up there, and I am always tempted to give up my path thinking I will go there and be with you. And if I go up, I am neither there nor here. We must not lose sight of this doctrine. It is all [a matter of] growth. Wait and grow, and you attain everything; otherwise there will be [great spiritual danger]. Here is the fundamental secret of teaching religion.\n[Source]\nTherefore, better die working out your own natural religion than following another’s natural religion, however great it may appear to you.\n[Source]\nEvery man should take up his own ideal and endeavour to accomplish it. That is a surer way of progress than taking up other men’s ideals, which he can never hope to accomplish. For instance, we take a child and at once give him the task of walking twenty miles. Either the little one dies, or one in a thousand crawls the twenty miles, to reach the end exhausted and half-dead. That is like what we generally try to do with the world. All the men and women, in any society, are not of the same mind, capacity, or of the same power to do things; they must have different ideals, and we have no right to sneer at any ideal. Let every one do the best he can for realizing his own ideal. Nor is it right that I should be judged by your standard or you by mine. The apple tree should not be judged by the standard of the oak, nor the oak by that of the apple. To judge the apple tree you must take the apple standard, and for the oak, its own standard.\n[Source]\nOn\n4 July 1902\n, Swamiji went for a morning walk with Swami Premananda. During the walk, Swamiji told Premananda,\n“You should not imitate me, remember Thakur(Sri Ramakrishna) said not to imitate anyone.”\nSri Ramakrishna Says —\n“I keep men’s own ideals intact. I ask a Vaishnava to hold to his Vaishnava attitude and a Sakta to his. But this also I say to them: “Never feel that your path alone is right and that the paths of others are wrong and full of errors.’ Hindus, Mussalmans, and Christians are going to the same destination by different paths. A man can realise God by following his own path if his prayer is sincere.

    "translation": "Arjuna said:\nO Krishna! Constrained by force as it were, by what does man commit sin even against his wish?",
    "commentary": "As the Lord continued his teaching about restraining the senses, overcoming Raga and Dvesha, and discharging one’s duty, Arjuna was seized with a deep doubt about the mysterious force that seems to compel man into evil in spite of his effort to avoid it. Such a doubt will naturally occur to every seeker and so the question and the Lord’s answer are of the greatest importance to mankind.\nWho does not know that indulgence in sense-pleasures is a mental slavery’ Who does not know that anger, spite, envy and pride are wrong mental attitudes? And most of the people yield to them even against their wish. No one desires to do evil or commit sin and yet some mysterious force seems to drive mankind into evil and sinful ways of life. What is that mysterious power? Where does it abide? How can it be counteracted; These things are essential for all seekers to know.\nOne should have a clear understanding of the cause and source of evil, and then only can its activity be neutralised. There are some plants that persist in sprouting up again and again, though the stem is cut off repeatedly. If the roots are pulled out and destroyed, there is no further danger of their growth. So the cause of the sin should be known, and if the cause is removed, the resulting evil would not be there.\nThe force of evil is in man himself. It is this power that drives man to do evil, though he knows that it is evil, and though he desires to avoid it. The Lord explains the nature of this mysterious force from the next verse onwards.\nThere are three types of individuals – (1) those who are free from evil (2) those who do not wish to do evil, and yet are under its sway, (3) those who do evil knowing it to be such. The first are Jivanmukthas, rare men who have crossed the ocean of samsara. The tricks and subterfuges of Maya cannot betray them into evil at any time and for any reason. The second type of men are sincere seekers. Arjuna’s question is from the standpoint of this type of men. The third type of men are evil-minded, sinful, plunged in darkness, reveling in sensuality, and embodying all that is hateful and self-destructive.\nBhagavad Gita 3.36 by Swami Sarvapriyananda\nThe root of this sin is desire, for worldly pleasures and prosperity. But a man does not give any heed to this desire, and so he is unable to know the root of evils (sins). He understands that he wants to abstain from committing sins, but some entity is forcibly engaging him, in sins. Duryodhana also declares:—\nजानामि धर्मं न च मे प्रवृत्तिः\nजानाम्यधर्मं न च मे निवृत्तिः।\nकेनापि देवेन हृदि स्थितेन\nयथा नियुक्तोस्मि तथा करोमि॥\n“I know what is righteousness, but I am not inclined to it; I also know what is unrighteousness, but I cannot get rid of it. There is some ‘deva’ (force) in my heart, which drives me to act” (Garga-Samhita, Asvamedha. 50/ 36).\nThe term ‘deva’ used by Duryodhana stands for desire, (for pleasure and prosperity) which forces him to commit sin, and not to follow righteousness. The expression ‘Kena prayukto’yam papam carati’— also shows that he is impelled to commit sin by some other force.\nThis shloka depicts the gap between “Knowledge” and “Application”.(or the Gap between Knowing and Becoming)\nThis shows one of the main differences between Duryodhana and Arjuna’s attitude. Duryodhana merely made a statement admitting the problem, seeking no way to correct it. But Arjuna actually questioned the problem, asking Krishna for help.\nIn the modern context, I think one of the most reasonable learning from this is – merely admitting that there is a problem is not sufficient to solve the problem. We need to know and question the problem to find a solution.\nStory of Suratha and Samadhi\nMarkandeya said: The eighth Manu is called Savarni, the son of Surya (Sun). I shall now tell you how he came into being. Due to the grace of Mahamaya, that lord of the Manvantara came to be the son of Surya.\nThere was a king called Suratha ruling over the whole earth. He ruled his subjects like his own children. He was once attacked by his enemies who tried to capture his city by force. He had a great fight with them. He was defeated in battle by those wicked ministers and kings of the hostile party and was compelled to leave his country. He felt extremely dejected, and mounting on a horse, singly went to a dense forest. There he saw an Ashram of a great Brahmin. There were many disciples in the Ashram, studying sacred lore. The king was received warmly by the sage.\nThere the king was wandering here and there and being caught by the force of ‘mineness’ he thought within himself, “Ah! What a sad state! Up to this time I was ruling this country, and now it is occupied by the enemy. My ministers were serving me faithfully, and now they are serving my enemies. My subjects were happy during my rule, and I do not know how they are being treated now. They are all serving a foreign ruler. My treasury will be completely used up by the enemies!” Thus and other things did the king ponder over.\nIn that Ashram, the king saw a Vaisya (the merchant-caste).\nThe king asked him, “Who are you? What are you doing here? Please tell me everything about you.” The Vaisya said, “My name is Samadhi. I was born in a wealthy family. But I was deprived of all my property by wicked people of my neighbourhood, and all my family, wife and children deserted me, and due to poverty I have taken shelter in this forest. I am filled with grief. I do not know what has happened to my wife and what my children are doing now. Whether they are living or dead I do not know.” The king said, “When your wife and children have deserted you, when you became penniless, why then, are you so much attached to them even now?” The Vaisya said, “O king! True exactly is what you say. I also know it. But what to do? Still I love them. The nature of mind is such. It loves even the wicked wife and the wicked children who have driven me out. I cannot help it.”\nMarkandeya said: Then they both, the king and the Vaisya, went to that sage who was residing in that Ashram. They both prostrated before the sage, and with great reverence the king questioned the sage, “O revered sage! I wish to ask you one question.\nO sage! I have lost all my territory. I have now nothing with me. But still I am having great attachment for my lost kingdom, wife and children. O sage, why is this? This is a Vaisya who has been deserted by his kith and kin due to his poverty and still he has got great attachment for his wife and children. We both are of the same type. We both are filled with grief. We both are deluded. Please destroy our ignorance through your wisdom.\nThe sage said: O king! Yes, there is that wisdom in every creature. Some animals are blind during the daytime, some are blind during the night. Some are of the same sight during night and day. Man has sight only during the day. Yet, all possess the same wisdom. What is all this? Why is this difference? Look at the moths falling on fire! Look at men falling in the fire of sensual objects! What difference is there among creatures here? In spite of intelligence, all creatures are struggling for the sake of belly. All are controlled and deluded by the Great Power, the Mahamaya of Vishnu! Due to Her Power all this world is working. Due to Her all are suffering. Due to Her all are happy. There is no wonder in this. Even Jnanis are dragged by this Maya by force, and they are totally deluded. She is the creator of this universe, mobile and immobile. She, being pleased, gives men the eternal salvation in the end. She is the cause of bondage and liberation. She alone is all in all. She rules supreme over all lords!\nThe king said: O sage! Who is that Devi Maya? How is She born? I wish to hear everything about Her, who works such wonders in this world.\n…. Then the Sage explained three stories of Devi Mahatmya. …..\nThe sage said: Thus I have recounted to you the entire story of the glories of Devi and Her actions. She is Vidya or the Intelligence-Principle of Vishnu-Sakti or Maya and She is the Avidya or the Ignorant principle too, and is above both. By Her only yourself and this Vaisya are deluded and many others also are deluded by Her in the same manner. O king! Take refuge in that Devi Maya! She is the giver of pleasure, Svarga and Moksha to Her devotees at the same time.\nMarkandeya said: Hearing these words of the Rishi, the King Suratha was very much moved at heart and immediately started to dense forests to perform rigorous penance. The Vaisya also followed him and began to perform Tapas on the bank of the river reciting Devi Suktam continuously. They wanted to have the vision of Devi in order to get back their lost kingdom and wealth. They prepared an image of Devi out of the mud from the river bank for the purpose of their worship with Shodasa-Upachara or the sixteen modes of worship to Devi. They both fasted and concentrated their minds on the glorious form of Devi. On their practising like this rigorous penance for three complete years, Devi was very much pleased and manifesting Herself to them spoke to them with these words. The Devi said, “O king! Whatever you want you can tell Me now. I am pleased with you. I am prepared to give you anything.”\nMarkandeya said: The king asked from Her the boon that he should get back his lost kingdom undaunted by any enemy. But the Vaisya asked from Devi Wisdom and nothing else.\nThe Devi said, “O king! In a few days you will regain your kingdom. You will conquer your enemies and rule over the land happily. After death you will be born through Surya (Sun) as the eighth Manu called Savarni. O Vaisya! As you desired I shall give you Wisdom. You will have Wisdom.”\nMarkandeya said: In this manner, giving the required boons to those two people, Devi vanished from sight immediately. Thus obtaining a boon from Devi, Suratha, the king, will be born through the Sun-God as the coming eighth Manu called Savarni.\nThus is the glorious story of Durga-Devi, the Mahamaya, the great Mother of the Universe!\n(Source: Sri Durga Saptashati or The Devi Mahatmya (The Glory of The Divine Mother) by Swami Sivananda)\nRelated Articles:\nBhagavad Gita: Chapter 3, Verse 5\nBhagavad Gita: Chapter 3, Verse 27\nBhagavad Gita: Chapter 18, Verse 59",

    "translation": "The Blessed Lord said: It is desire, it is anger, born of Rajoguna (the impulse of action), all-consuming and all-evil. Know this as the enemy here.",
    "commentary": "Here the Lord explains the secret of the mysterious force that compels man to commit sin, though he does not wish it. Knowing full well that an act is evil, and sincerely wishing to avoid it, man, however, does it in spite of himself. This is within the experience of all human beings. The Lord analyses the force, and says that the twin evils of kama and krodha constitute the power behind all the sins committed by man.\nKama and Krodha are wicked twins like Ravana and Kumbhakarna, like Hiranyaksha and Hiranyakasipu. The aforesaid raga and\ndvesha\nare manifestations of kama and\nkrodha\n. Of these two, kama is the first and krodha is but the effect of kama. The first is the cause and the second is the effect. When there is no cause there can be no effect. When there is no kama, there is no krodha. Kama is therefore said to be the first of the six evil tendencies in man – Kama, Krodha, Lobha, Moha, Mada and Matsarya. Kama is the captain of the team of inimical forces which harass mankind, and stand directly in the way of Self-realisation.\nThe Lord describes Kama and Krodha by two significant epithets. Kama is all-devouring (Mahasanah). Like fire, it burns, Consuming everything that is offered to satisfy its hunger for enjoyment. Fire is not extinguished so long as you pour oblations of oil and ghee into it. They only add to its consuming power. Such is kama. The attempt to satisfy it only makes it stronger and more clamorous for further and further enjoyment. How then can it be conquered? Let no fuel be added to the fire and the fire weakens and dies in ashes. So also,\nlet no attempt be made to satisfy kama, and it dies a natural death\n. The rejection of desire as soon as it is born is the way to overcome it.\nConstant inquiry into the nature of the Self, which is bliss itself, will naturally eliminate desires from the mind\n. When man by his birth-right is the very source and fountain-head of all bliss, why does he need small external objects to give him joy and pleasure? So the seeker should constantly contemplate the blissful nature of his real Self.\nThose twin evils are all sinful (\nmahapapam\n). The most heinous sins are committed, the greatest disasters of the human race are caused by these forces. The little good that man has accumulated through a series of births is neutralised and overweighed by the amount of sin committed by kama and krodha.\nLust and greed form the food for Kama. When kama is frustrated it takes the ugly form of krodha (wrath).\nAgain they are described as the foes of man.\nThey are the nearest and the greatest enemies of man.\nThrough a series of births, they have acquired an undisputed mastery over the heart of man.\nHaving occupied the innermost recesses of the heart, they have been exercising control and authority over man’s impulses and conduct in the material world.\nThe whole personality of man is thus enslaved by a secret and powerful enemy for a long time. They have brought their associates also – Iobha, moha, mada and matsarya – into the inner part of man’s heart. These evils act with wonderful co-ordination. If one is suppressed another comes up. If that is suppressed, the former crop up again. With different shapes and forms, at unexpected times and in unexpected places, they show themselves up and harass the weak and unfortunate human beings.\nTherefore the Lord speaks inspiring words to the seeker to conquer the enemy with courage and determination, however long and hard the struggle may be. The forth-coming verses ending with\n“jahi satrum mahabaho”\nis the Lord’s magnificent exhortation to defeat and destroy the enemy in every way possible.\nBhagavad Gita 3.37 by Swami Sarvapriyananda\nBhagavad Gita 3.36 and 3.37 by Swami Sarvapriyananda",

    "translation": "As fire is enveloped by smoke, as a mirror by dust, as an embryo by the amnion, so this knowledge of the Self is enveloped by Kama and Krodha.",
    "commentary": "In the heart of every being, the light of Atma is always shining. But it is not seen because it is covered up by kama and krodha. To explain this, the Lord uses three illustrations – (1) as fire being covered by smoke, (2) a mirror being covered by dust, and (3) the embryo being enveloped by the amnion. When smoke is cleared away by fanning, the fire underneath shines bright. When the dust is rubbed off, the mirror shines in all its purity. Also when the amnion is removed the newborn comes out free from the womb. In the same way, when the enveloping force of kama is dispelled by the practice of devotion, dispassion, selfless action, and knowledge, the light of Atma shines forth in all its effulgence. When Atma manifests, man attains liberation and gets freedom from all-enveloping forces.\nMoreover, fire is not extinguished by smoke, nor does the mirror lose its original purity by dust. The enveloping amnion does no harm to the embryo. So also,\nthough kama envelops Atma, Atma is not at all affected by it.\nThus even in the state of ignorance, Atma is there in all its original purity. It is never touched or transformed or acted upon by anything. It remains in its own pristine purity. As it is covered up, it does not manifest its light. That is all. When the covering is taken off, it shines forth as it is. There is no change in Atma. Knowledge simply means our being conscious of the purity of Atma. Atma is there, even when you do not know it. One’s ignorance or knowledge of Atma does not make any difference in its existence, for it exists by its own right, unconditioned by time, place, and causation. If a person changes his dress, does it make any difference in the body itself? No. The change is in the dress and not in the body. Looking at a landscape through a hole, one can see only a part of it. As the opening is made bigger and bigger, more and more of the landscape is revealed. All the time it is not the landscape that is changing. It is the opening that changes. So it is with Atma. When kama covers it, people do not see it, when kama is cast away they see it. Atma is there always, eternally pure and eternally perfect.\nMan’s duty is to realise Atma by taking off the flimsy covering that is hiding the effulgent spirit. It is in one sense not difficult at all. A fan can blow off the smoke, a piece of cloth can rub the dust away from the mirror. So let the seeker take courage and slowly remove the enveloping Kama from his heart. The light of the Self reveals itself slowly but surely.\nThis (Idam) – Knowledge of the Self. In the succeeding verse, the word Jnanam is directly used. and so the pronoun ‘this’ here should convey the same meaning – knowledge of the Self.",

    "translation": "O Arjuna! Knowledge of the Self is covered by this everlasting foe of the wise in the form of desire, insatiable like fire.",
    "commentary": "The Lord elaborates the theme of kama, for it is the worst enemy of man, and more of its nature should be understood before one could deal with it in a suitable manner and overcome its destructive influence.\nKama is the ever-lasting foe of the wise (\nNitya Vairi\n) and it is insatiable like fire.\nBirth after birth, this formidable foe harasses man continuously. External enemies are not so persistent. Sometimes a former enemy may become a present friend. So they are not perpetual enemies. But Kama is a constant foe, ever-scheming and plotting how to fringe and bring down the spiritual aspirant. Highly learned scholars, kings and heroes, the Gods of the different worlds, are struck down by kama at one time or other. Even highly advanced spiritual seekers, if they are not careful for a minute, are trapped by kama and lose their freedom. Though its external manifestations are checked by conscious efforts, yet it remains in a seed-form in the heart, and comes out when there is a suitable opportunity. So the seeker should be vigilant and with firm determination should strike down the enemy whenever he lifts his head in any form whatsoever.\nInsatiable like the fire:\nLike fire, kama can never be appeased. Any amount of fuel may be thrown into the fire, yet we do not find the fire crying ‘enough’. Such is kama. Enjoyments do not reduce the power of kama. On the other hand, it becomes stronger and stronger after every pleasure offered to appease it. It is already described as ‘all-devouring’ (\nmahasana\n). The attempt to fill kama is as futile as to draw water from a river in a sieve. The word\nanalena\nmeaning fire is significant.\nAlam\nmeans enough,\nanalam\nmeans not enough. That is, the fire never says ‘enough’ however much you may feed it with fuel. Such is kama, and like fire, it burns anyone who touches it.\nSo the policy of appeasement should be given up, and a total war should be declared against the enemy.\nEverlasting foe of the wise:\nTo the spiritual aspirant who is striving to know the Truth, kama is the immediate and most dangerous foe. When one is awakened from the dream of desire followed by enjoyment, and enjoyment followed by further desire he tries to progress towards Truth. Then he would understand how kama had enslaved him, how bitter and short-lived its pleasures were, how hard and long should be the struggle to destroy this subtle enemy whom he fed and entertained as the ruling principle of his life through a series of births.\nBhagavad Gita 3.39 by Swami Sarvapriyananda\nSri Ramakrishna Says —\nMASTER:\n“‘Woman and gold’ is the cause of bondage. ‘Woman and gold’ alone constitutes samsara, the world. It is ‘woman and gold’ that keeps one from seeing God. (\nHolding the towel in front or his face\n) Do you see my face any more? Of course not. The towel hides it. No sooner is the covering of ‘woman and gold’ removed than one attains Chidananda, Consciousness and Bliss.\n“Let me tell you something. He who has renounced the pleasure of a wife has verily renounced the pleasure of the world. God is very near to such a person.”\nThe devotees listened to these words in silence.\nMASTER (\nto Kedar, Vijay, and the other devotees\n):\n“He who has renounced the pleasure of a wife has verily renounced the pleasure of the world. It is ‘woman and gold’ that hides God. You people have such imposing moustaches, and yet you too are involved in ‘woman and gold’. Tell me it isn’t true.\nSearch your heart and answer me.\n“\nVIJAY:\n“Yes, it is true.”\nKedar remained silent.\nMASTER:\n“I see that all are under the control of woman. One day I went to Captain’s house. From there I was to go to Ram’s house. So I said to Captain, ‘Please give me my carriage hire.’ He asked his wife about it. She too held back and said: ‘What’s the matter? What’s the matter?’ At last Captain said, ‘Ram will take care of it.’ You see, the\nGita\n, the\nBhagavata\n, and the Vedanta all bow before a woman! (\nAll laugh\n.)\n“A man leaves his money, his property, and everything in the hands of his wife. But he says with affected simplicity, ‘I have such a nature that I cannot keep even two rupees with me.’\n“A man went to an office in search of a job. There were many vacancies, but the manager did not grant his request. A friend said to the applicant, ‘Appeal to Golapi, and you will get the job.’ Golapi was the manager’s mistress.\n“\nMen do not realise how far they are dragged down by women.\nOnce I went to the Fort in a carriage, feeling all the while that I was going along a level road. At last I found that I had gone four storeys down. It was a sloping road.\n“A man possessed by a ghost does not know he is under the ghost’s control. He thinks he is quite normal.”\nVIJAY (\nsmiling\n):\n“But he can be cured by an exorcist if he finds one.”\nIn answer to Vijay Sri Ramakrishna only said, “That depends on the will of God.” Then he went on with his talk about women.\nMASTER:\n“Everyone I talk to says, ‘Yes, sir, my wife is good.’ Nobody says that his wife is bad. (\nAll laugh\n.) Those who constantly live with ‘woman and gold’ are so infatuated with it that they don’t see things properly. Chess-players oftentimes cannot see the right move for their pieces on the board. But those who watch the game from a distance can understand the moves more accurately.\n“Woman is the embodiment of maya. In the course of his hymn to Rama, Narada said: ‘O Rama, all men are parts of Thee. All women are parts of Sita, the personification of Thy maya. Please deign to grant that I may have pure love for Thy Lotus Feet and that I may not be deluded by Thy world-bewitching maya. I do not want any other favour than that.'” (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\nRelated Articles:\nO mighty-armed Arjuna!

    "commentary": "When a person wants to destroy an enemy he must, first of all, know what his stronghold is, and from which place he is attacking him. The stronghold of kama is the senses, the mind, and the intellect. With these under its power, kama veils the knowledge of Self and deludes mankind by attachment to the body and the material world. So the first step for the seeker is to bring the senses under his own control, by driving out kama from its stronghold. Then the mind becomes pure, and the discriminative intellect clear. When kama is thus driven out of its hiding place and feeding ground, it becomes weak and gradually dies for want of sustenance.\nBhagavad Gita 3.40 by Swami Sarvapriyananda\nSwami Vivekananda Says —\nBeware, Arjuna, lust and anger are the great enemies. These are to be controlled. These cover the knowledge even of those [who are wise]. This fire of lust is unquenchable. Its location is in the sense-organs and in the mind. The Self desires nothing.\n[Source]\nSri Ramakrishna Says —\nM. had been staying at Dakshineswar with Sri Ramakrishna. The Master was sitting in his room, listening to the life of Prahlada, which Ramlal was reading from the\nBhaktamala\n. M. was sitting on the floor. Rakhal, Latu, and Harish were also in the room, and Hazra was on the verandah. While listening to the story of Prahlada’s love for God, Sri Ramakrishna went into an ecstatic mood.\nHiranyakasipu, the king of the demons and father of Prahlada, had put his son to endless torture to divert the boy’s mind from the love of God. But through divine grace all the king’s attempts to kill Prahlada were ineffective. At last God appeared, assuming the form of Nrisimha, the Man-lion, and killed Hiranyakasipu. The gods were frightened at the rage and roaring of the Man-lion and thought that the destruction of the world was imminent. They sent Prahlada to pacify the Deity. The boy sang a hymn to Him in words of love, and the Man-lion, moved by affection, licked Prahlada’s body.\nStill in an ecstatic mood, the Master said, “Ah! Ah! What love for the devotee!” The Master went into deep samadhi. He sat there motionless. A tear-drop could be seen at the corner of each of his eyes.\nThe Master came down to the plane of the sense world and spoke to M., expressing his abhorrence for those who, while practising spiritual discipline, enjoyed sex-life.\nMASTER:\n“Aren’t you ashamed of yourself? You have children, and still you enjoy intercourse with your wife. Don’t you hate yourself for thus leading an animal life? Don’t you hate yourself for dallying with a body which contains only blood, phlegm, filth, and excreta? He who contemplates the Lotus Feet of God looks on even the most beautiful woman as mere ash from the cremation ground. To enjoy a body which will not last and which consists of such impure ingredients as intestines, bile, flesh, and bone! Aren’t you ashamed of yourself?”\nM. sat there silently, hanging his head in shame.\nMASTER:\n“A man who has tasted even a drop of God’s ecstatic love looks on ‘woman and gold’ as most insignificant. He who has tasted syrup made from sugar candy regards a drink made from treacle as a mere trifle. One gradually obtains that love for God if one but prays to Him with a yearning heart and always chants His name and glories.”\nThe Master was in an ecstasy of love. He began to dance about the room and sing:\nWho is singing Hari’s name upon the sacred Ganges’ bank?\nIs it Nitai that has come, the giver of heavenly love? . . . (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\nFrom ‘Discourses on Shri Ramcharitamanasa by Swami Tejomayananda’ —\nSaints proclaim that where Śrī Rāma is, no desire for sensual pleasure exists and where the aspiration for worldly pleasure prevails, there Śrī Rāma is absent. Light and darkness cannot co-exist simultaneously at one and the same place.\nWe need to reflect on how we can fill our mind with Śrī Rāma. There is a secret to it. Just think, how does desire arise in the mind? When we perceive objects through the senses–as sound, touch, form, taste, and smell–the cause for desire manifests. That does not imply that desire will definitely arise but it becomes a distinct possibility. We may go to the mall to buy just one thing but exit with a trolley load of stuff. That is because once we enter the mall, we see this, that, and the other and the mind prompts us to buy them all. It is only when we go to the chemist to purchase medicine that we generally return with only that. Where did desire come from? From seeing, hearing, touching, tasting, and smelling; these are the gateways for the entry of desire.\nDesire can awaken by the direct perception of objects through the senses. It can also be triggered by memory when the mind recollects earlier pleasurable experiences. The third source of desire is the intellect: thinking of and anticipating future pleasures. Such thoughts stimulate desire. Therefore, it is imperative to be extremely alert about what we see, remember, and think. Thus, to sum up, the senses perceive things in the present, the mind recalls pleasures enjoyed in the past while the intellect dwells on the pleasures sought after in the future.\nDesires also have their own character, and the nature of the desire is dependent on the kind of thoughts entertained. One type is of an extremely tāmasika nature, which pertains to obscene and vulgar things. The sight of rājasika things will give rise to rājasika desires. Sāttvika memories such as that of Chinmaya Vibhooti, for example, will engender the sāttvika desire of revisiting that Centre. Tāmasika and rājasika desires create bondage. Here we are instructed that if such desires arise, for whatever reason, we should instantly start remembering Śrī Rāma. When we listen to the glories of the Lord there will be no desire for sensual pleasure; instead we will long for a vision (darśana) of Śrī Rāma. What is it that we seek to behold with our eyes? If it is the desire to see the temple of the Lord, then that desire will be fulfilled.\nIn the Bhagavad Gītā Śrī Kṛṣna tells us how desire arises in the mind–\nindriyāṇi mano budhirasyādhiṣṭhānamucyate, etairvimoha yatyeṣa jñānamāvṛtya dehinaṁ\n(3.40): The senses, mind and intellect are said to be the seat of desire. Through these, it deludes the embodied jivā by veiling his wisdom. We have five sense organs and five organs of action, that is, ten organs. In addition, we have the inner equipment of mind, (mana) intellect, (buddhi) memory (citta) and sense of individuality (ahaṁkāra). All together this makes for a total of fourteen gateways of desire. Understanding this is the secret of controlling desire.\nThe mind vacillates, the intellect decides, the memory recalls the past and then the ego says, “I want to enjoy this.” In other words, if in these fourteen desire-provoking locations of the personality we establish the longing for the attainment of the form and nature of the Lord, then the vāsanā for worldly enjoyment will gradually disappear. All that will remain in the heart of the seeker is love for God. And in such a heart the Lord will ever abide.\nOf all the organs of perception, the eyes and the ears are the most powerful and exercise the greatest influence on us. That is why they are specially mentioned in the śānti mantra–\nbhadraṁ karṇebhiḥ śṛuṇuyāma devāḥ, bhadraṁ paśyemākṣabhiryajatrāḥ\n: O devas, with our ears may we hear all that is auspicious and with our eyes, see all that is auspicious. In comparison, what we see with the eyes is less than what we imbibe through the ears. Knowledge and information are, by and large, gained through listening rather than by seeing.\nThe Self does not need the body. In fact, the body only creates limitations and trouble for the Infinite Being. The Infinite Being’s glory is made to appear limited by the body. The Self is not dependent on the body. It is ever-free—nityamukta. Its infinite intelligence is curtailed by the limited intellect. Its boundless perceiving capacity is limited by the senses. Its transcendental intelligence is restricted by the limited mind. Thus, the intellect, the senses and the mind… all serve only to limit the Infinite.\nबुद्धीन्द्रियमनःप्राणान् जनानामसृजत् प्रभुः।\nमात्रार्थं च भवार्थं च आत्मनेऽकल्पनाय च॥ SB 10.87.2\nThe creator created the intellect, the senses, the mind and the prāṇa for measuring the sensory objects, and also for becoming—to take birth after birth. These limitations cloud the Self-Experience, the Atman. (Source: Srimad Bhagavad Gita – Elixir of Eternal Wisdom)",

    "translation": "O Arjuna! Therefore, having controlled the senses in the beginning, kill surely this kama, the sinful destroyer of knowledge and Self-realisation.",
    "commentary": "Kama (lust) functions by first enslaving the senses, then deluding the mind, and then confusing the intellect. In the actual act of enjoyment, no one can make the division. But sadhana consists in analysing the mechanism of the body and mind. The Lord insists on sense-control as the first step to get rid of kama. The senses are like the main gateway of a fort. If the enemy is attacked and repelled at the gate, he cannot enter the fort. The senses should not be allowed to possess the mind by filling it with sense objects of pleasure. So the senses should be controlled first. The enjoyments derived through the senses should be given up by the practice of discrimination and dispassion. This is the starting point of spiritual advancement. The Lord says to every seeker “Whatever other obstacles and difficulties there may be, look to this first. Control the senses. Other things shall follow later.” Therefore let every seeker examine the outgoing senses, and find out the objects towards which they are running. Then let him turn away from them by examining and understanding their filthy nature.",

    "translation": "They say that the senses are superior (to the body), superior to the senses is the mind, superior to the mind is the intellect, but superior than the intellect is He (the Atman).",
    "commentary": "In the previous verses, sense-restraint is enjoined as the first condition of spiritual progress. But how to achieve it? The Lord answers it in this verse. Unless one stands above his enemy or acquires greater strength than the enemy, he cannot defeat him. So one should understand what the position of the senses is in the organism of the human being. No doubt the senses are superior to the bodily organs like hands and legs because they have a wider range of activity. But the mind is superior to the senses because it has a still wider range of activity and is endowed with higher powers of generating action. But the intellect is superior to the mind because the operations of the mind are subject to the dictates of the intellect which directs the mind in its various activities. But higher than the intellect and greater than all, stands Atma, the omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent, ever-blissful Self. The Self is All-mighty. Nothing can touch it or affect it. In the Sankhya Yoga, the Lord has already described the glory and indestructibility of Atma.\nThe Atma is the one conscious principle in the Universe. All else is jada- Anatma -a mass of insentience.\nIt is the presence of Atma that gives life and activity to the insentient mass, right from the intellect down to the body.\nA ball of iron is illumined when fire enters and pervades it. So Atma enters and pervades the whole universe, giving it the appearance of life and activity. All this life belongs to Atma. He is the Reality in everything.\nSo, keeping oneself in the Atmic state is the most powerful antidote to the intellect. When one acquires a stand in Atma, these lower functional instruments are deprived of the usual ramblings in the world of matter, and so they automatically come to a standstill in their own respective positions. They can no longer draw the person out and entangle him in the meshes of sense-enjoyments. Even the relish or taste for enjoyment is killed when Atma is directly perceived and experienced.\nThus the Lord points out the way to conquer the senses, the mind, and the intellect, all at once. ‘Never descend to the lower plane of the senses. All should ascend to the state of Atma’,- this is the injunction of the Lord. The lower things then cannot trouble the person for he would then understand that he is actually the witness to the modifications of the mind and the senses, and have nothing to do with them at all. ‘We are not the body, we are not the senses, we are not the mind, we are not the intellect, we are blessed Atma, pure and perfect, infinite and ever-blessful.’ When this thought is firmly held, the senses lose their power over the individual and cannot betray him into sinful acts and ways of life.\nBhagavad Gita 3.42 by Swami Sarvapriyananda",

    "sanskrit": "एवं बुद्धे: परं बुद्ध्वा संस्तभ्यात्मानमात्मना |\nजहि शत्रुं महाबाहो कामरूपं दुरासदम् || 43||\nevaṁ buddheḥ paraṁ buddhvā sanstabhyātmānam ātmanā\njahi śhatruṁ mahā-bāho kāma-rūpaṁ durāsadam\nevam—thus; buddheḥ—than the intellect; param—superior; buddhvā—knowing; sanstabhya—subdue; ātmānam—the lower self (senses, mind, and intellect); ātmanā—by higher self (soul); jahi—kill; śhatrum—the enemy; mahā-bāho—mighty-armed one; kāma-rūpam—in the form of desire; durāsadam—formidable",
    "translation": "O mighty-armed Arjuna! Thus, having known what is greater than the intellect (i.e.) Atma, and restraining the mind by the intellect conquer the foe (kama) in the form of desire which is indeed hard to overcome.",
    "commentary": "The cause of all sorrow is the ignorance of man of his real Self. Thinking that he is the body, the senses, and the mind, he attributes to himself all their distractions, disturbances, agitations and sufferings.\nThis identification with the material body and the world is the root cause of all sorrow and suffering.\nSo the Lord exhorts all mankind, “Know that you are the Self which is beyond the intellect You are not the body. So take refuge in the Self and conquer the indomitable foe – Kama.” This is the Lord’s inspiring message to suffering humanity.\nIn fact, it is Atma that impregnates all material things with consciousness, power and activity. Whatever power is displayed by the bodily organs, the senses, and the mind, all that power is derived from Atma which is One indivisible ocean of power and blessedness. But as we see, these insentient instruments have acquired the appearance of reality by the interpretation of Avidya. They have, as it were, become the real, and what is real (i.e.) Atma is covered up by them. People have, so to say, realised the unreal, and unrealised the real. Now, therefore, the seeker has to make the hard distinction between the apparently real, and the really real. He should distinguish the unreal which is appearing as the real. If the Reality, Atma is experienced the body, the senses, the mind, the intellect – would immediately be subdued and brought under control. Thus Kama is conquered, the bonds of ignorance are broken, the Power of the Supreme is realised.\nTherefore, discrimination – persistent discrimination – between the real and the unreal is the first and foremost practice for the aspirant. By this he would know that the various actions and functions of the senses, the mind and the intellect, have no absolute reality at all. Atma is separated from Anatma. Then all that is not Atma loses its mysterious power over the individual. Man then feels the freedom of the Self-the state of the jivanmukta. The ignorant man has tied a strong knot between Atma and Anatma. This knot should be cut so that insentient matter is clearly distinguished from the life and light of Atma. To the realised man, Atma alone appears everywhere, as the immovable, unchanging, imperishable, substratum of all that exists. Then these senses and the mind remain under his control and become servants to carry out the command of the master, the Self.\nIf the brake is applied, the fast-moving train comes to a standstill. If the connecting link is cut, the fast whirling wheel of the vast machine stops rotating. Thus the mighty wheel of birth and death comes to a stand-still, when the Self is realised. There is no other way to stop the wheel of samasara. If the phenomenal world is cut off from its deluding connection with the Self, the whole of it ceases to have any meaning or life or significance. The delusion banishes by the knowledge of Atma. The external world will be known as a mirage and no one would run after a mirage when he knows it to be such. The senses do not run after material things, the mind does not hanker after pleasures and enjoyment, and the intellect has no more any part to play in the scheme of things. There is no further quest for this or that. The Self alone shines as the eternal Truth. It is this grand and inspiring idea which is presented to us in this magnificent verse.\nOne should naturally feel the power of the inspiring words – ‘Oh ! mighty – armed Arjuna ! conquer the foe (jahi satrum mahabaho).’ Arjuna is addressed as the mighty-armed warrior. True.\nThe aspirant should be like Arjuna, a hero who knows no defeat, who is ready to sacrifice his life for attaining the highest.\nHis motto should be ‘Conquer’. But what kind of foe is he to conquer? The foe to be conquered is hard indeed to overcome (durasadam). It is no use to underestimate the power of the enemy. The enemy (Kama) is powerful because it has sent its roots deep into the heart of man and has developed into a mighty many-branched tree. It should be cut and the roots pulled out of the solid earth.\nThe sword that can cut this mighty tree of Kama is detachment from the unreal and identification with Atma.\nThis is the axe which would cut the mighty tree.\nKnowledge of the Self is the last word of the Lord in this Discourse, Karma Yoga, the Yoga of action.\nWe understand that Karma yoga demands detachment and desirelessness and this is possible only when man understands Atma. So knowledge is the foundation of Karma yoga. Nishkama Karma leads to Jnana, and Jnana makes Nishkama Karma possible.\nSo those who desire to cross the ocean of sorrow, those who aspire to conquer Kama, those who seek for liberation, should understand their real nature, that they are Atma and not dead matter, the body, etc. When they know this, whether they are in cities or forest, whether they are young or old, whether they work or cease to work, they would enjoy the supreme peace of Atma, and the world has no power to bind them again.\nBhagavad Gita 3.43 by Swami Sarvapriyananda\nWhen desires invade the mind, what should one do? The answer Bhagavan gives is\nsaṃstabhyātmānamātmanā\n—make the Self abide in the Self. This is found in the Gita itself, ‘ātma-samstham manaḥ krtvā, na kincidapi cintayet (\nBG 6.25\n)—make the mind abide in the Self, and do not initiate any thought.’ The moment you rub the mind with the mind, it generates thoughts. And thoughts power up the ego. The ego itself is the root of thoughts. When the ego is woken up, the intellect gets eroded, through which the mind and the senses become active, and spread out as desires. Thus, ‘Do not think’ is the secret. Abide as the Self. That alone is the way to cross the border of desire and to be beyond the reach of desire. (Source: Srimad Bhagavad Gita | Elixir of Eternal wisdom)",
