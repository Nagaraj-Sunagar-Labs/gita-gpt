    "commentary": "It was declared that action contrary to Sastraic commands cannot lead to perfection (\n16.23\n&\n16.24\n). But there are people who have not read the Sastras either by indifference or incompetence or other reasons, and yet who believe in a higher power and carry on some form of worship and perform sacrifices. These men are different from the demonical type because the latter entirely denies the existence of the Higher power. These people have faith, but it is not in conformity with the Sastras. What is their condition? What is the nature of their worship? This is Arjuna’s question.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda\nBhagavad Gita: Chapter 17 🔻 (28 Verses)\n01\n02\n03\n04\n05\n06\n07\n08\n09\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28",

    "translation": "The faith of each man is in accordance with his natural disposition. A man, Ο Bhārata, is made of his faith; what his faith is, that verily he is.",
    "commentary": "The mind (the inner organ) is alone the Jiva (man). So if the mind is pure, purity becomes the essence of that man. Here the word ‘\nsattva\n‘ means mind. Every individual acquires that nature which he has brought with him from his experience in former births. And his faith takes on that quality only. He is that faith, qualified by his Samskaras. So it is the duty of man to instill Sattvic disposition into his character and by practice transcend that also to reach the highest state. The Tamasic and Rajasic kinds of Sraddha should be abandoned, because they also pull man downwards into lower forms of existence. Among the qualities, Sattva is the nearest to Atma, and in Suddha-sattva, man directly perceives Atma, and enters the Nirguna state. That is the real Self of man, that is his final goal.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda\nSwami Vivekananda Says —\nWhat I think is practical, is to me the only practicality in the world. If I am a shopkeeper, I think shopkeeping the only practical pursuit in the world. If I am a thief, I think stealing is the best means of being practical; others are not practical. You see how we all use this word practical for things we like and can do. Therefore I will ask you to understand that\nVedanta, though it is intensely practical, is always so in the sense of the ideal.\n[Source]\nThe Bhagavad Gita states: “A man consists of the faith that is in him. Whatever his faith is, he is.” A man of faith is free from fear, worry, and anxiety. Once there was a terrible fire in a neighbour’s house which was only fifteen yards from his own. A strong wind was blowing and occasionally sparks fell on Nag Mahashay’s roof. While the villagers were fighting to stop the blazing fire, Nag Mahashay stood before it with folded hands, unperturbed. Sharatkamini, however, was frightened and started throwing clothes, bedding, and blankets outside. Seeing her, Nag Mahashay cried out: “Shame on you! Still you have no faith in God! Brahma, the god of fire, has come. Instead of worshipping him, you are busy protecting these trifling objects! Victory to Sri Ramakrishna!” He started to dance in the courtyard. Then he added, “If God protects, no one can destroy; and if God destroys, no one can save.” The neighbour’s house was burned to the ground, but Nag Mahashay’s house remained undamaged. (Source: They Lived with God)\nSri Ramakrishna Say —\n“Shall I tell you the truth? Man loves his own riches, and so he thinks that God loves His, too. He thinks that God will be pleased if we glorify His riches. Once Sambhu said to me, ‘Please bless me, that I may die leaving my riches at the Lotus Feet of God.’ I answered: ‘These are riches only to you. What riches can you offer God? To Him these are mere dust and straw.’\n“Once a thief broke into the temple of Vishnu and robbed the image of its jewels. Mathur Babu and I went to the temple to see what was the matter. Addressing the image, Mathur said bitterly: ‘What a shame, Lord! You are so worthless! The thief took all the ornaments from Your body, and You couldn’t do a thing about it.’ Thereupon I said to’Mathur: ‘Shame on you! How improper your words are! To God, the jewels you talk so much about are only lumps of clay. Lakshmi, the Goddess of Fortune, is His Consort. Do you mean to say that He should spend sleepless nights because a thief has taken your few rupees? You mustn’t say such things.’\n“Can one ever bring God under control through wealth? He can be tamed only through love. What does He want? Certainly not wealth! He wants from His devotees love, devotion, feeling, discrimination, and renunciation.\n“\nOne looks on God exactly according to one’s own inner feeling.\nTake, for instance, a devotee with an excess of tamas. He thinks that the Divine Mother eats goat. So he slaughters one for Her. Again, the devotee endowed with rajas cooks rice and various other dishes for the Mother. But the sattvic devotee doesn’t make any outer show of his worship. People don’t even know he is worshipping. If he has no flowers, he worships God with mere Ganges water and the leaves of the bel-tree. His food offering to the Deity consists of sweetened puffed rice or a few candies. Occasionally he cooks a little rice pudding for the Deity.\n“There is also another class of devotees, those who are beyond the three gunas. They have the nature of a child. Their worship consists in chanting God’s name — just His name. (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\n—–\n“People of bygone generations had tremendous faith. What faith Haladhari’s father had! Once he was on the way to his daughter’s house when he noticed some beautiful flowers and vilwa-leaves. He gathered them for the worship of the Family Deity and walked back five or six miles to his own house.\n“Once a theatrical troupe in the village was enacting the life of Rama. When Kaikeyi asked Rama to go into exile in the forest, Haladhari’s father, who had been watching the performance, sprang up. He went to the actor who played Kaikeyi, crying out, ‘You wretch!’, and was about to burn the actor’s face with a torch. He was a very pious man. After finishing his ablutions he would stand in the water and meditate on the Deity, reciting the invocation: ‘I meditate on Thee, of red hue and four faces’, while tears streamed down his cheeks.\n“When my father walked along the lanes of the village wearing his wooden sandals, the shopkeepers would stand up out of respect and say, ‘There he comes!’ When he bathed in the Haldarpukur, the villagers would not have the courage to get into the water. Before bathing they would inquire if he had finished his bath.\n“When my father chanted the name of Raghuvir, his chest would turn crimson. This also happened to me. When I saw the cows at Vrindavan returning from the pasture, I was transported into a divine mood and my body became red.\n“Very strong was the faith of the people in those days. One hears that God used to dance then, taking the form of Kali, while the devotee clapped his hands keeping time.” (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\n—–\n“The sannyasi’s way of living is like observing the ekadasi fast without taking even a drop of water. If he clings to enjoyment, then he has reason to be afraid. ‘Woman and gold’ is enjoyment. If a monk enjoys it, he is swallowing his own spittle, as it were. There are different kinds of enjoyment: money, wealth, name, fame, and sense pleasures. It is not good for a sannyasi to sit in the company of a woman devotee, or even to talk to her. This injures him and others as well. Then others cannot learn from him; he cannot set an example to humanity. A sannyasi keeps his body in order to teach mankind.\n“To sit with a woman or talk to her a long time has also been described as a kind of sexual intercourse. There are eight kinds. To listen to a woman and enjoy her conversation is one kind; to speak about a woman is another kind; to whisper to her privately is a third kind; to keep something belonging to a woman and enjoy it is a fourth kind; to touch her is a fifth. Therefore a sannyasi should not salute his guru’s young wife, touching her feet. These are the rules for sannyasis.\n“But the case is quite different with householders. After the birth of one or two children, the husband and wife should live as brother and sister. The other seven kinds of sexual intercourse do not injure them much.\n“A householder has various debts: debts to the gods, to the fathers, and to the rishis. He also owes a debt to his wife. He should make her the mother of one or two children and support her if she is a chaste woman.\n“Householders do not know who is a good wife and who is a bad wife, who is a vidyasakti and who is an avidyasakti. A vidyasakti, a good wife, has very little lust and anger. She sleeps little. She pushes her husband’s head away from her. She is full of affection, kindness, devotion, modesty, and other noble qualities. Such a wife serves all, looking on all men as her children. Further, she helps increase her husband’s love of God. She doesn’t spend much money lest her husband should have to work hard and thus not get leisure to think of God.\n“Mannish women have different traits. These are bad traits: squint eyes and hollow eyes, catlike eyes, lantern jaws like a calf’s, and pigeon-breast”\nGIRISH:\n“What is the way for people like us?”\nMASTER:\n“\nBhakti is the only essential thing. Bhakti has different aspects: the sattvic, the rajasic, and the tamasic.\nOne who has sattvic bhakti is very modest and humble. But a man with tamasic bhakti is like a highwayman in his attitude toward God. He says: ‘O God, I am chanting Your name; how can I be a sinner? O God, You are my own Mother; You must reveal Yourself to me.'”\nGIRISH (\nsmiling\n):\n“It is you, sir, who teach us tamasic bhakti.” (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\nOne day we asked: “Does God exist? How can one see God?”\nThe Master replied: “God really exists. You do not see stars during the day, but that does not mean that the stars do not exist. There is butter in milk, but can anyone know this by looking at milk? In order to get butter you must churn the milk in a cool place before sunrise. If you want to catch fish in a pond, you have to learn the art of fishing from those who know it, and then you must throw the line into the water and sit patiently with a fishing rod. Soon the fish will grab the bait. Then, as soon as the float sinks, you can pull the fish to shore. Similarly, you cannot realize God by merely wishing. Have faith in the instructions of a holy man. Make your mind like a fishing rod and your prana, or life force, like a hook. Your devotion and japa must be like the bait. Eventually you will be blessed by the vision of God.”\nPreviously we had not believed in the existence of God. Furthermore, after associating with the Brahmo Samaj we had come to believe that God is formless. The Master read our minds and said: “Yes, God can be seen. Could God, whose creation is so beautiful and enchanting, be imperceptible?”\nWe said: “Sir, whatever you say is true. Who can refute you? Is it possible to realize God in this life?”\nThe Master replied: “You get what you desire. Faith alone is the key to success.” Then he sang a song:\nAs is a man’s meditation, so is his feeling of love;\nAs is a man’s feeling of love, so is his gain;\nAnd faith is the root of all.\nIf in the Nectar Lake of Mother Kali’s feet My mind remains immersed,\nOf little use are worship, oblations, or sacrifice.\nThe Master continued: “The more you advance in one direction, the more you leave behind the opposite direction. If you move ten steps towards the east, you move ten steps away from the west.”\n— Ram Chandra Datta (Source: Ramakrishna as We Saw Him)\nHe who considers himself free is free indeed and one who considers himself bound remains bound. “As one thinks, so one becomes,” is a popular saying in this world, and it is quite true. (\nAshtavakra Gita 1.11\n)\n“As a man thinketh in his heart, so is he” is a phrase from the Bible,\nProverbs 23:7\n.\nOne can attain success in any endeavor if one perseveres with firm determination (MB 12.153.116). Whatever a person of purified mind desires, is obtained (MuU 3.01.10). The doer of good acts becomes good, and the doer of evil becomes evil. One becomes virtuous by virtuous deeds and vicious by vicious acts (BrU 4.04.05). We all have the power to change. One becomes what one constantly and intensely thinks of, irrespective of reasons, such as reverence, fear, jealousy, love, or even hatred (BP 11.09.22). You always get what you look for — consciously or unconsciously. The thought produces action; action soon becomes habits and habit leads to success in any endeavor when it becomes passion. Become passionate about what you want to achieve, and you will achieve it. Burning desire brings out the dormant forces.",

Such being the importance of food, the Lord first prescribes the type of food which is dear to the Sattvic type of men.\nSri Ramakrishna Says —\nMASTER (\nto M\n.):\n“Rakhal has indigestion.

    "translation": "Food that is excessively bitter, sour, salty, hot, acrid, dry, and burning is liked by people endowed with rajas. It causes pain, grief, and disease.",
    "commentary": "Such is the food relished by the Rajasic people, the effect of such food is immediately felt by pain in the body and consequent mental discomfort. The word\n‘ati’\nis applied to all the adjectives used, by some commentators. Sour, bitter, and burning food-stuffs should be abandoned, if spiritual progress is to be kept up by the Sadhaka.\nIn the\neighteenth Discourse 38th verse\n, the Lord explains that Rajasic happiness appears to be pleasing in the beginning but turns out to be extremely painful in the end. Similarly hot and sour food may be relishing to some palates, but they produce grievous discomfort, pain and disease, in the end. This is experienced by many in everyday life. Besides, Rajasic food disturbs Dhyana Sadhana. The mind becomes distracted and agitated and so it cannot remain steady in contemplation. Among the animals, lions, tigers, and wolves are restless and foul, whereas cows, goats and others of their kind are calm and non-injurious.\namayapradah:\nRajasic food produces disease. What can man achieve with a disease-sticken body? He has neither worldly nor spiritual welfare. So the seekers should abandon all such varieties of food and strive in every way to keep the body light, pure and strong. The choice of food is in itself a part of self-discipline and an important aspect also. We find real Sadhakas extremely fastidious about their food. They take food and water at regular intervals, and do not load the stomach at all odd times with all odd food-stuffs. Such discipline goes a long way to secure self-control easily and these men rise to higher planes of spiritual experience. That should be the standard to be followed by all earnest seekers.",

Therefore for physical health and joy, only Sattvic food should be taken.\nSwami Vivekananda Says —\nWhat the proper food is, what kind, we have to determine ourselves. Nobody can determine that [for us]. As a general practice, we have to shun exciting food. … We do not know how to vary our diet with our occupation. We always forget that it is the food out of which we manufacture everything we have. So the amount and kind of energy that we want, the food must determine. … The proper diet means, generally, simply do not eat highly spiced foods. There are three sorts of mind, says the yogi, according to the elements of nature. One is the dull mind, which covers the luminosity of the soul. Then there is that which makes people active, and lastly, that which makes them calm and peaceful. Now there are persons born with the tendency to sleep all the time. Their taste will be towards that type of food which is rotting — crawling cheese. They will eat cheese that fairly jumps off the table. It is a natural tendency with them. Then active people. Their taste is for everything hot and pungent, strong alcohol. … Sattvika people are very thoughtful, quiet, and patient. They take food in small quantities, and never anything bad.\n[Source]\nBhagavad Gita: Chapter 17 🔻 (28 Verses)\n01\n02\n03\n04\n05\n06\n07\n08\n09\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28",

    "commentary": "The Lord has already laid down the law that the Sastras are the authority about what ought to be done or what ought not to be done. Therefore it is said here that the Yajna should be ‘\nvidhidrishtah\n‘. Moreover it should be decided after deep consideration whether to perform the sacrifice or not, according to time, place and other circumstances. Above all this, it should be performed without any selfish motive. It should be an act of Nishkama karmayoga. Such Yagna is called Sattvic.\nHere the word ‘Yajna’ does not mean sacrifice of animals and other living beings. It refers to all charitable and beneficient acts of a divine character. Any good done in that spirit becomes a Yajna.\nManah samadhaya:\nIt is imperative that the act to be performed should be carefully considered, decided, and fixed before doing it. Otherwise, the wavering mind creates hundred doubts and fears at the time of performing it. Such actions do not bear any good fruit at all. They are sometimes half done and left incomplete. The doer gains no peace or satisfaction from such works. So one should consider the pros and cons, satisfy himself about the Sastraic laws, take the advice of the elders and well-wishers, and then only go into action. Such work is Sattvic and yields the best door to rewards to the doer and to the world. The point is that there should not be any longing to taste the fruits of work. They should be offered to the Lord. Such work is the highest and the noblest.\nBhagavad Gita 17.11 to 17.13 by Swami Chetanananda",

    "commentary": "Verses 14, 15 and 16, which deal with the restraint and discipline of the body, speech, and mind, are of the greatest importance for all seekers. They should practise the three-fold austerity, and attain perfect purity of body, speech and mind. Such purity at once leads to self-realisation.\nTapas is intended to purify the body and mind through which the individual has to function and strive for Atmajnana. Unless the body is purified internally and externally, the highest knowledge cannot be experienced. The word Tapas is generally associated with severe self-denial and self-mortification. People think that Tapas is suffering in heat and cold, abstaining from food, standing on one leg or keeping hands uplifted, and such other feats of physical endurance. Such horror-producing practices are not at all mentioned by the Lord. No one needs to be terrified by the word tapas. The Lord’s interpretation is practical and within the easy reach of any seeker who is striving for Atmajnana. Men and women can practise it. So, it is the duty of all sincere aspirants to undertake the discipline mentioned here and attain the goal.\nThe austerity of the body consists of five clear practices mentioned below:\n(1) Reverence towards and worship of elders, Mahatmas, and devotees. By such worship, two great rewards are reaped by the worshipper. He acquires their grace and his egoism vanishes. Spiritual development is not possible without the grace of God, Guru and Mahatmas. Maya does not easily give way for man to cross over. The obstacles cannot be cleared without their grace. So the real seeker should win their blessing by humility and reverence, by service and devotion, by worship and selfless service. Their grace is infinitely helpful for man. He becomes humble, wise, unselfish and the super-obstacle the Ego lets go its strangle-hold on the heart of man. That is why the Lord mentioned such worship as the first type of austerity for the body.",

In the Vedas and the Sastras, the Pranava and other associated Mantras have been explained for the benefit of all spiritual aspirants.\nTasya Vachakah pranavah:\nOm is the sound symbol of Paramatma\nTajjapas tadartha Bhavanam (Patanjali)\n“The name (Om) should be uttered repeatedly and its meaning should be deeply contemplated.” – If there are any errors and mistakes in the practice of Karma (Yajna, Japa, Dhyana etc.) all of by them are rectified by the utterance of these three symbols of Brahman Om Tat Sat. Therefore, the utterance of Om has become the practice at the beginning of any form of Karma. Every Mantra has the symbol Om prefixed to it. But when the symbols Om Tat Sat are uttered, their meaning should be kept in mind, and the Supreme Brahman should be meditated through these symbols.\nAll mantras acquire power when their meaning and significance are clearly contemplated in the mind.\nIt is declared that Vedas and Yajnas were created from this triple designation (Om Tat Sat). So it is the origin, the source of the Vedas. The very essence of all the Vedas is, as it were, distilled into that one symbol ‘Om’. So, the utterance of this sacred syllable is equal to the study of all the Vedas.\nAnother interpretation for Om Tat Sat – Om: Para Brahman; Tat: That (Brahman alone); Sat: is (reality) Everything else in the entire objective universe is only a shadow unreal (Mithya).\nTherefore the Mantra\nOm Tat Sat\nimplies the very highest truth of all the Vedas and the Sastras – Brahma satyam jagan mithya (Brahman is real, the universe is unreal). Thus the aspirants should utter this unique Mantra, contemplate the reality of Brahman, reject the unreal world, and develop dispassion and knowledge. They should firmly establish themselves in Brahman, the only reality.\nTwo meanings could be given to Om Tat Sat as follows:\n1. Om: Brahman (is); Tat: that (Brahman); Sat: Reality;\n2. Tat: that; Sat: Reality; Om: (is) Brahman.\nBhagavad Gita 17.23 to 17.28 by Swami Chetanananda",

Thus performed without any longing for personal rewards, these acts purify the mind and pave the way for Moksha. The renunciation of the fruits of actions is one of the main tenets of the Gita, and it is absolutely the pre-condition for Self realisation.\nMoreover, we understand that the aspirants of Moksha should perform all these acts of sacrifice, and charity, while remaining unconcerned about their fruit. These acts are not to be abandoned, because they are helpful to purify the mind, and to reach the goal of liberation. The Lord insists on action as the purifying agent indispensable for spiritual realisation. The same idea is repeated in the next discourse also\nYajna dana tapah karma\nna tyajyam kāryam eva tat (\n18.5\n)\nSome are of the view that no good acts should be done because even good acts bind man. The teacher of the Gita does not subscribe to this view. On the other hand, He emphasises that good acts should not be abandoned; they should be performed. Therefore, the seekers of liberation should undertake all good actions like sacrifice, charity, austarity etc., purify themselves, and attain Brahmajnana.",

    "translation": "Steadfastness in sacrifice, austerity, and gift is also called “Sat”; and so too is any action connected therewith.",
    "commentary": "The Lord affirms the performance of sacrifice, austerity and charity, again and again. Steadfastness in performing these acts itself is the Brahman, designated by the word ‘Sat’. Thus we can imagine the holiness of these acts. They are ‘Sat’. Moreover, all auspicious acts done for the sake of the Supreme are also named ‘Sat’. All such acts of inner purification, lead to the same goal-Brahman. In this manner, Brahman whose form is existence (isness) (Sat) is to be realised by these acts which are also called ‘Sat’. The condition to be carefully noted is that these acts should be performed for the sake of that Brahman, renouncing the fruits to God, and with no motive of personal gain. Then only they are ‘Sat’ and lead to Tat (That). Otherwise, the plane of action does not change. They are just like the hundred and one other actions that are usually done for personal profit and bind them to the wheel of Samsara.\nAction in itself cannot bind. It binds when one is attached to its fruits and desire to enjoy worldly benefits through them.\nThen they are not ‘Sať’, because they are practised for the sake of the world (Asat) and not for the sake of Brahman (Sat). The Lord teaches the Divinity of action in this verse. Knowing this, the seekers of truth should perform the best forms of action like Yajna, Tapas and Dana, with the ultimate aim of realising Brahman and attaining perfection and freedom.",

    "translation": "Whatever sacrifice or gift is made, whatever austerity is practised, whatever ceremony is observed— it is all called “asat,” “non-existent,” if it is done without faith. It is of no account here or hereafter.",
    "commentary": "Faith (\nsraddha\n) is the Key-note of success either in worldly life or in spiritual life. Without it, nothing is achieved even in small matters concerning everyday life. In spiritual life where man tries to ascend to the highest state the need for unswerving faith is greatly emphasised. That is why the Lord insists on faith in many places and He has devoted a whole Discourse to elaborate on the theme of faith (sraddha). Whatever may be the act performed by either Yajna or Dana or Tapas, or other good works, If there is no faith in the heart of the doer, it becomes utterly useless. It does not acquire the status of ‘Sat’. It is just ‘Asat’ (i.e.) something equal to zero, something not performed at all. Such acts bring no good either here or hereafter. A person may gather all materials for preparing food, and yet, if the cook has no ‘\nsraddha\n‘ in what he is doing, the whole thing goes to waste. So also, in the spiritual field, whatever other qualities the aspirants may possess, if he is void of faith, his austerities, sacrifices and charities bear no fruit at all. It remains only in the realm of the ‘Asat’ and cannot be transformed into ‘Sat’. Therefore it is the duty of all seekers to do their ‘sadhana’ with faith and realise the goal. Even a little of such ‘sadhana’ with faith will help to realise the Self. And such ‘sadhana’ does not at all go in vain. Thus, holding on to faith as the support, propelling force, and guiding light, man has to march forward towards the ultimate reality, the supreme Brahman.\nOne day the Holy Mother invited Amzad for lunch and served him on the porch of her house. Owing to caste prejudices, Nalini, the Mother’s niece, threw the food at Amzad’s leaf plate from a distance. Holy Mother noticed this and said: “How can one enjoy food when it is served with such scorn? Let me wait on him properly.” After Amzad had finished his meal, Holy Mother cleaned the place where he had sat with her own hands. Nalini shrieked: “Aunt, you have lost your caste!”\n“Keep quiet,” the Mother scolded her. Then she added: “As Sharat is my son, exactly so is Amzad.” Sharat was a direct disciple of Ramakrishna, the secretary of the Ramakrishna Mission, and a monk endowed with saintly virtues; Amzad was a Muslim and a convicted robber. Thus Holy Mother demonstrated that she is the Mother of the good and the bad. She also showed that kind treatment can enkindle faith in the heart of a weak, lowly man and prove to him that he is a son of the Divine Mother. Her example brought to life the words of Krishna: “I am the same towards all beings; to Me there is none hateful or dear. But those who worship Me with devotion—they are in Me, and I too am in them.”\nOne morning in Jayrambati while the Mother was rubbing her body with oil, someone was sweeping the courtyard. After the work was done, that person threw the broomstick aside. At this the Mother said: “What is this? You have thrown away the broomstick with such disrespect when the work is done. It takes the same amount of time to put it gently in a corner as it does to throw it aside. One should not trifle with a thing though it may be very insignificant. If you respect a thing, the thing also respects you. Will you not again need that broomstick? Besides, it is also a part of this family. From that standpoint also, it deserves to be treated with respect. Even a broomstick should be treated with respect. One should perform even an insignificant task with respect.”",
