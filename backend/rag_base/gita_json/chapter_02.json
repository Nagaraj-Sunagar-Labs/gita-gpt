    "commentary": "Bhagavad Gita Chapter 2 Verse 1 by Swami Sarvapriyananda\nWith eyes blurred with tears:\nThis is the sign of intense dispassion.\nAll earthly attachments and family pleasures and the glories and the enjoyments of dominion appear worthless trash\n, and Arjuna yearns to escape from the bondage which keeps him as a prisoner in a dark cell. There is only one thought for the prisoner, and that is to regain his freedom and to see the light. So feels the ignorant man, when he is burdened with the weight of sorrow. Such is the experience of Arjuna. It is the first and the foremost qualification for receiving the highest knowledge. One who does not possess this intense dispassion cannot receive the supreme knowledge. Even if it is taught to him, he cannot understand it. It is wasted in the same way as one attempts to dye a dirty piece of cloth. Thus we come to know that Arjuna qualified himself for supreme wisdom by his intense dispassion in the present situation.\nFilled with pity:\nKindness is no doubt a great quality. But there are situations when kindness becomes a mental weakness. To be moved with pity after deciding to fight a righteous war for establishing\nDharma\nis not nobility of human nature, but a weak state of mind that is not capable of standing up to the strain of duty and righteous action. For the Kshatriya, a righteous war for the sake of justice is a duty. Arjuna was moved by a feeling which amounts to a weak wavering state of mind and it is against this weakness that Lord Krishna’s exhortation is directed. The blessed Lord makes it clear to Arjuna that this is not the occasion and these are not the people for whom he should feel this kind of pity. As a Kshatriya, it is Arjuna’s duty to fight the battle.\nBhagavad Gita: Chapter 2 🔻\n(72 Verses)\n01\n02\n03\n04\n05\n06\n07\n08\n09\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n61\n62\n63\n64\n65\n66\n67\n68\n69\n70\n71\n72",

So he confesses that power and lordship over the three worlds cannot remove the withering sorrow. The storm does not abate. The only cure for all diseases of the mind is the knowledge of Atma. It is this supreme panacea that Lord Krishna offers to Arjuna. Therefore it is clear that what one should strive for in this life is not power or position or enjoyment but the knowledge of the Supreme Self.\n❮ Previous\nNext ❯",

    "commentary": "Bhagavad Gita Chapter 2, Verse 10 by Swami Sarvapriyananda\nAs if laughing :\n`Hasan’ means laughing, `prahasan’ means laughing loud. The man of knowledge is generally amused when he hears the talk of the ignorant and observes what they say and do. Arjuna was caught in the grip of sorrow, as he did not understand the hidden laws of Dharma. Lord Krishna was the very embodiment of knowledge and Dharma. Therefore the specious arguments of Arjuna, the spurious feelings of pity and compassion, the mental distraction, and physical collapse of Arjuna, raised a smile on the lips of the Lord. Those who have not transcended `avidya’ suffer from a false identification with the creations of ‘Maya’, the body and mind and other worldly objects. The man of knowledge on the other hand knows that he is never contaminated by the modifications of the body and mind, and looks at them from the vantage point of a disinterested spectator.\nThat is the difference between the wise and the ignorant. When a man sees a rope and knows it as only a rope, he is naturally amused to see a man of defective sight who takes the rope to be a snake and jumps about in fear and confusion.\nThe father laughs at the peculiar ideas and behaviour of his little children.\nSo does the wise men smile at the fanciful theories and conduct of the ignorant. Lord Krishna was the master of Yoga and Jnana. To him Arjuna’s peculiar argumentation, his bodily and mental agitation appeared laughable. So a smile beautified the sublime features of the Lord when he observed the mental acrobatics of his former friend and present disciple. Look at this picture and that – the wailing Arjuna and the smiling Lord. Such exactly is the difference between the wise and the ignorant.\nSwami Vivekananda Says —\nIn our miseries and struggles the world seems to us a very dreadful place. But just as when we watch two puppies playing and biting we do not concern ourselves at all, realising that it is only fun and that even a sharp nip now and then will do no actual harm, so all our struggles are but play in God’s eyes. This world is all for play and only amuses God; nothing in it can make God angry.\n[Source]\n❮ Previous\nNext ❯",

    "commentary": "Bhagavad Gita Chapter 2, Verse 11 by Swami Sarvapriyananda\nThe teaching of the Gita starts from this Sloka. So in the Gita-Sastra, this verse is regarded as the seed or source (Bija). Just as the whole tree is involved in the seed, the whole of the `Gita Sastra’ is implied in this Sloka.\nThe message of the Gita starts with the word ‘Asochyan’ and ends with the words ‘ma suchah’ (do not grieve). So it appears that the main purpose of the Gita teaching is “the removal of sorrow.”\nThose who should not be grieved for:\nEvery object in the world has five aspects: (1) existence, (2) light, (3) joy, (4) name, and (5) form. Of these, the first three -existence, light, and joy (sat, chit, ananda) are real and eternal. The later two, name and form (nama and rupa) are unreal and transitory. The first three constitute the real nature of man, and not name and form. But such is the power of ignorance (`avidya’) that man sees, knows and clings to the later two only – namely name and form. The first three are not directly seen, though they are experienced every moment of life. Thus, if we analyse and go a little deeper into the real nature of man, we find that it is indestructible and eternal. Only the later two go on continuously changing from time to time. Therefore, since the real man is eternal, one need not weep and wail for the modifications of name and form which he observes in life and death. When the real man is deathless, for whom should we grieve, and for what? That is the Lord’s position.\nWords of wisdom:\nIntellectual arguments are conceived by Buddhi, by which power man comes to decisions after due consideration. But the intellect is finite. It operates within a limited range. It cannot go beyond the Buddhi. Buddhi and the intellect are parts of nature, and they are subject to errors and mistakes in their concepts and conclusions. But it is different with men who have crossed the border land of the intellect and entered the realm of Atma – the superconscious state. He alone knows and speaks the truth. Arjuna did not attain that state. So he measures every thing with the yardstick of his own deluded intellect. His arguments not to fight the battle are of this nature. Lord Krishna dismisses them all in one suggestive phrase (Prajnavadah) and proceeds to state the ultimate position.\nThe wise:\nOrdinarily a Pandit is one who is well-versed in the languages and literature, poetry and scripture, logic and oratory. But the Lord here gives a new definition for the word. He is a pandit who grieves not either for the living or the dead.\nAgain in the 4th Chapter, Pandit is described as one who has burnt up all actions in the fire of ‘\nJnana\n‘. And again in the 5th Chapter, the Pandit is described as one who looks upon all with an equal eye.\nSo the word should be understood in the higher sense of a man of wisdom. It is necessary that besides mere learning and book-knowledge he should attain the knowledge of\nAtma\nand receive the grace of God.\nSwami Vivekananda Says —\nThere is a conflict in Arjuna’s heart between his emotionalism and his duty. The nearer we are to [beasts and] birds, the more we are in the hells of emotion. We call it love. It is self-hypnotization. We are under the control of our [emotions] like animals. A cow can sacrifice its life for its young. Every animal can. What of that? It is not the blind, birdlike emotion that leads to perfection. … [To reach] the eternal consciousness, that is the goal of man! There emotion has no place, nor sentimentalism, nor anything that belongs to the senses — only the light of pure reason. [There] man stands as spirit. Now, Arjuna is under the control of this emotionalism. He is not what he should be — a great self-controlled, enlightened sage working through the eternal light of reason. He has become like an animal, like a baby, just letting his heart carry away his brain, making a fool of himself and trying to cover his weakness with the flowery names of “love” and so on. Krishna sees through that. Arjuna talks like a man of little learning and brings out many reasons, but at the same time he talks the language of a fool. “The sage is not sorry for those that are living nor for those that die.”\n[Source]\nEven forgiveness, if weak and passive, is not true: fight is better. Forgive when you could bring legions of angels to the victory. Krishna, the charioteer of Arjuna, hears him say, “Let us forgive our enemies”, and answers, “You speak the words of wise men, but you are not a wise man, but a coward”. As a lotus-leaf, living in the water yet untouched by it, so should the soul be in the world. This is a battlefield, fight your way out. Life in this world is an attempt to see God. Make your life a manifestation of will strengthened by renunciation.\n[Source]\nSri Ramakrishna Says —\nThe Brahmo devotees looked wistfully at the Master. Gradually he came back to sense consciousness; but the divine intoxication still lingered. He said to himself in a whisper:\n“Mother, why have You brought me here? They are hedged around and not free. Can I free them?”\nDid the Master find that the people assembled there were locked within the prison walls of the world? Did their helplessness make the Master address these words to the Divine Mother?\nSri Ramakrishna was gradually becoming conscious of the outside world. Nilmadhav of Ghazipur and a Brahmo devotee were talking about Pavhari Baba. Another Brahmo devotee said to the Master: “Sir, these gentlemen visited Pavhari Baba. He lives in Ghazipur. He is a holy man like yourself.” The Master could hardly talk; he only smiled. The devotee continued,\n“Sir, Pavhari Baba keeps your photograph in his room.” Pointing to his body the Master said with a smile, “Just a pillow-case.”\n(Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\n—–\nThe devotees had placed flowers and garlands before him as their loving offerings. He picked up a flower and touched with it first his head, then his throat, heart, and navel. To the devotees he seemed a child playing with flowers.\nSri Ramakrishna used to tell the devotees that his divine visions and moods were accompanied by the rising of a spiritual current inside his body.\nNow he talked to M.\nMASTER:\n“I don’t remember when the current went up. Now I am in the mood of a child. That is why I am playing with the flowers this way. Do you know what I see now? I see my body as a frame made of bamboo strips and covered with a cloth. The frame moves. And it moves because someone dwells inside it.\n“Again, I see the body to be like a pumpkin with the seeds scooped out. Inside this body there is no trace of passion or worldly attachment. It is all very clean inside, and —” It became very painful for Sri Ramakrishna to talk further. He felt very weak. M. quickly guessed what the Master wanted to tell the devotees, and said, “And you are seeing God inside yourself “\nMASTER:\n“Both inside and outside. The Indivisible Satchidananda — I see It both inside and outside. It has merely assumed this sheath [meaning his body] for a support and exists both inside and outside. I clearly perceive this.\nM. and Hirananda listened intently to these words about his exalted state of God-Consciousness. A few moments later Sri Ramakrishna looked at them and resumed the conversation.\nMASTER:\n“You all seem to me to be my kinsmen. I do not look on any of you as a stranger.\n“I see you all as so many sheaths, (Referring to their bodies.) and the heads are moving.\nI notice that when my mind is united with God the suffering of the body is left aside.\n“Now I perceive only this: this: indivisible Satchidananda is covered with skin, and this sore in the throat is on one side of it.”\nThe Master again fell silent. A few minutes later he said: “The attributes of matter are superimposed on Spirit, and the attributes of Spirit are superimposed on matter. Therefore when the body is ill a man says, ‘I am ill.'” (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\nThe wise man, having realised Atman as dwelling within impermanent bodies but Itself bodiless, vast and all- pervading, does not grieve. (\nKatha Upanishad 1.2.22\n).\nPeople meet and depart in this world as two pieces of wood flowing down the river come together and then separate from each other (Mahabharata 12.174.15).",

    "commentary": "Bhagavad Gita Chapter 2, Verse 12 by Swami Sarvapriyananda\nThe Immortality of the Soul by Swami Sarvapriyananda\nThrough this verse, the Lord teaches the `Mahavakya’\n“tat tvam asi” (Thou art That)\n‘I’, ‘you’ and all beings in the world are all forms of the one Supreme Self.\nSo the individual being and the Supreme Being are not two separate entities, but one and only one. This is the most secret of all spiritual secrets. This is the essence of Brahma Jnana.\nSince Arjuna renounced all the powers and pleasures of the three worlds, Lord Krishna considered him fit to receive the supreme knowledge, and so begins to teach the highest Truth.\nThree important facts come out in the Lord’s declaration that all beings are eternal.\nAtma is eternal,\nEach individual being is Atma and not the body with name and form,\nThe one Atma pervades all beings in the world.\nThis teaching inspires tremendous strength and courage. When a man comes to know that he and others essentially do not perish, there is no cause for grief at all. Death is then regarded as only a change of name and form. When the seed breaks up and grows into a plant, there is no need for grief at all. The name and form of the seed have disappeared, but it is there in the form of a plant. Lord Krishna found out the root cause of Arjuna’s grief and sorrow, and he knew that the knowledge of Atma alone could put an end to all weakness and despondency. So he starts his teaching with the tremendous affirmation of the immortality of the Soul and the deathlessness of the individual being.\nAll of us hereafter:\n‘all of us’ – From the point of view of the Supreme Self, there is no separation between God, Guru, and the common man. All belong to the same eternal existence. So we find that Anjaneya speaking to Sri Rama says: (Atma budhya tvamevaham). The individual being manifesting as the ego is the result of the limitations of the body, mind, and senses. When these `limitations are discarded, the so-called individual being, the ego, becomes veritably the all-pervading Supreme Self. That is the Reality. Knowing that he is the immortal Atma, where is sorrow, where is weakness? Thus the Lord inspires Arjuna with courage born of knowledge.\nSwami Vivekananda Says —\nYou cannot die nor can I. There was never a time when we did not exist. There will never be a time when we shall not exist.\n[Source]\nPeople talk about the beginning of the world, the beginning of man. The word beginning simply means the beginning of the cycle. It nowhere means the beginning of the whole Cosmos. It is impossible that creation could have a beginning. No one of you can imagine a time of beginning. That which has a beginning must have an end. “Never did I not exist, nor you, nor will any of us ever hereafter cease to be,” says the Bhagavad Gita. Wherever the beginning of creation is mentioned, it means the beginning of a cycle. Your body will meet with death, but your soul, never.\n[Source]",

When from boyhood one passes to youth, and from youth to age, he does not grieve. No one grieves when the seed dies as it is giving birth to the plant. And so, the Lord questions why one should grieve when the body falls and another is taken up by the individual being. The wise who know the secret remain firm when these changes overtake the body. The first three stages are seen and known by all, but the fourth change is unseen and so it is looked upon with a feeling of awe and wonder. But the Lord points out that even this change is just like the former and not in the least different from them. So he exhorts everyone to know the truth and be fearless. It should however be remembered that the Jnani whose ‘karmic’ force is already exhausted has no need to take another body. The common man is subject to the law of rebirth till the last when he too becomes free.\nCycle of the body :\nBoyhood – Youth – Old Age – Rebirth.\nThe cycle rotates inevitably so long as the karma force works. When it is destroyed by knowledge, the man is freed from the cycle of birth and death. This is liberation (Moksha).",

But those who know that these modifications belong to the realm of the body only and that the Self remains untroubled and uncontaminated by them, are free from pleasure and pain, and such men live always in a state of happiness. However, so long as man is in the embodied state, even the Jnani must go through the physical changes. But since he knows the sharp distinction between the body and Atma, his attitude to them is entirely different from that of the ignorant man. So the Lord’s command is ‘endure them’. (`Titikshasva’). There is no other way.\nProducers of pleasure and pain:\nThe pleasure experienced by the senses is not pure pleasure. It is mixed with pain. If it is a pure pleasure, it should not have any touch of pain either -before or afterward. Elsewhere in the Gita, it is said that the\npleasures derived through contact of the senses with worldly objects are themselves the source of pain\n. The common experience is also the same. The same thing causes pain and pleasure under different circumstances, in varying degrees.\nThere can be no such thing as pleasure apart from pain. They are the two sides of the same coin.\nThey are called `dvandvas’ – pairs of opposites, which always go together. So the Lord speaks of them together as producers of pleasure and pain (sukhadukhadah).\nWith beginning and end:\nWhen worldly pleasures come no one need be elated, for their nature is not simply to appear but to disappear also, and where there is elation there should be depression. Pleasures come as guests and again depart. They are transitory and short-lived. Therefore one should not get himself attached to them. Such attachment will always lead to pain when they disappear, and it is absolutely certain that they disappear in course of time. He is then the ‘dhira’- the man of courage, who is disinterested in them and feels no attraction for them. The foolish man is deluded by the superficial attractions offered by sense objects, runs after them, and gets himself caught in the whirlpool of Samsara. And besides, even a casual observer knows that not desired by him, several painful things come to him by the power of providence in the cyclic motion of time, and he should be in a position to conclude that even pleasures would come similarly through time, and precious life need not be wasted for obtaining such pleasures. The duty of every thoughtful man is to seek Truth in the midst of this changing phenomena, and the unadulterated Ananda which is pure and perfect and which brings no pain in its wake. The Lord exhorts Arjuna to seek such permanent joy.",

    "commentary": "Bhagavad Gita Chapter 2, Verse 15 by Swami Sarvapriyananda\nChief among mortals:\nHe who has controlled the senses, who is not attracted by worldly objects, and who is equal-minded in pain and pleasure, is the best of men. Worldly greatness is not enough, but along with it, one should acquire spiritual excellence also. Then alone he becomes the chief among mortals. The Lord exhorts Arjuna to acquire spiritual greatness, and so he addresses him as ‘chief among mortals’ – (Purusharshabha)\nEqual in pain and pleasure:\nFirmness of character implies equanimity of mind under all conditions of pain and pleasure. He is firmly fixed in Atma who feels that the pairs of Opposites (`dvandas’) are only modifications of the body and mind. Pleasure is only a wave of the mind, and pain is also a wave of the mind. The Atma is above the mind. It is a witness of these changes. So the firm man is indifferent to them, like Suka in the court of Janaka.\nHe is fit for immortality:\nLiberation is known as immortality. The world of name and form is dead matter, Jada. It is subject to birth and death. The state of Atma is deathless. So liberation is not something to be acquired fresh by man, but it is his essential nature. It is not something existing in the Heaven or sky. It is immortality here and now and forever. He who attains this state does not come under the power of death. He has no need to take a body again.\nFitness for\nMoksha\nis not here confined to any race, religion, or caste. The Lord simply says that the man of heroic endurance and equal-mindedness is alone fit for liberation. There is no distinction of caste or creed.",

    "commentary": "Bhagavad Gita Chapter 2, Verse 16 by Swami Sarvapriyananda\nKnowers of the truth:-\nThis refers to persons who have directly seen the final Truth. For them, lt is no longer speculation or argument or more imagination, but direct perception. Such realised men understand clearly what is real and what is not real. The body and the world are subject to destruction, and so they are not the truth; They are non-existent. That which becomes non-existent cannot have a state of reality at any time. Even if it appears to be real, it is the reality of the mirage only. The Atma alone is real. At no time was it not. At no time will it cease to be. The man of knowledge knows the truth. Others who are ignorant confuse the two by ascribing reality to the unreal (body and the world) and denying the real, (the Atman). This Confusion is the root cause of all sorrow and suffering for mankind.\nTo deny the existence of the real Atma, who alone is real, is the first error. To assert the existence of the unreal, body and world, is the second error. The first error is known as `asambhavana’ and the second error `viparitabhavana’. By the first error, what is real vanishes and so the eternal Atma becomes something that is far away from us. By the second error what is palpably unreal is taken for the real and thus the ignorant man brings upon himself endless suffering and sorrow. To end the sorrow, it is just enough for the man to see the real as real, and the unreal as unreal. This is the way to peace and the removal of sorrow. The spiritual masters know the secret and hence they are filled with bliss. The ignorant man fails to see the Truth, and so he is caught in the whirlpool of ‘\nsamsara\n‘ and suffers endlessly.\nIn this verse, Lord propounds the fundamental pre position of Vedanta. ‘Brahma Satyam, Jagat midhya’.",

Why should a wise man be sorry?” And where is the beginning of this emotionalism that has got hold of you?

It is unchangeable. There is nothing in the universe that can change [the Changeless]. Though this body has its beginning and end, the dweller in the body is infinite and without end.”\nKnowing this, stand up and fight! Not one step back, that is the idea. … Fight it out, whatever comes. Let the stars move from the sphere! Let the whole world stand against us! Death means only a change of garment. What of it? Thus fight! You gain nothing by becoming cowards. … Taking a step backward, you do not avoid any misfortune. You have cried to all the gods in the world. Has misery ceased? The masses in India cry to sixty million gods, and still die like dogs. Where are these gods? … The gods come to help you when you have succeeded. So what is the use? Die game. … This bending the knee to superstitions, this selling yourself to your own mind does not befit you, my soul. You are infinite, deathless, birthless. Because you are infinite spirit, it does not befit you to be a slave. … Arise! Awake! Stand up and fight! Die if you must. There is none to help you. You are all the world.

The sense of action and the feeling of activity belong to Buddhi only and do not touch Atma which is beyond Buddhi. He is an ignorant man who ascribes action to Atma.\n2. Atma is imperishable and so it cannot be slain. It is eternal and unchanging. Therefore, the spiritual aspirant should persistently contemplate that he is the immortal Atma, the witness of the physical and subtle bodies, the ever pure and perfect.\nSwami Vivekananda Says —\nAny action that you do for yourself will bring its effect to bear upon you. If it is a good action, you will have to take the good effect, and if bad, you will have to take the bad effect; but any action that is not done for your own sake, whatever it be, will have no effect on you. There is to be found a very expressive sentence in our scriptures embodying this idea: “Even if he kills the whole universe (or be himself killed), he is neither the killer nor the killed, when he knows that he is not acting for himself at all.” Therefore karma-yoga teaches, “Do not give up the world; live in the world, imbibe its influences as much as you can; but if it be for your own enjoyment’s sake, work not at all.” Enjoyment should not be the goal.\n[Source]",

This shows clearly that the Gita is the – essence of the\nUpanishads\n.\nThough the body is destroyed, yet the all-pervading Atma never dies. It shows that Atma remains only as a witness to the modifications of the body like birth, youth, and death, and of the mind in the form of pain and pleasure. The disturbance of the storm clouds does not affect the sun or the sky through which they pass. Therefore man should not identify himself with the foul perishable body and the ever-functioning mind but should hold on to his identity with the Self. Supreme joy and courage are realised by the wise who are one with Atma. The fear of death is at once driven off by the knowledge that he is the immortal Atma.\nSwami Vivekananda Says —\nNow freedom is only possible when no external power can exert any influence, produce any change. Freedom is only possible to the being who is beyond all conditions, all laws, all bondages of cause and effect. In other words, the unchangeable alone can be free and, therefore, immortal. This Being, this Atman, this real Self of man, the free, the unchangeable is beyond all conditions, and as such, it has neither birth nor death. “Without birth or death, eternal, ever-existing is this soul of man.”\n[Source]\nSri Ramakrishna Says —\nADHAR (\nto the Master\n):\n“Sir, I have a question to ask. Is it good to sacrifice animals before the Deity? It certainly involves killing.”\nMASTER:\n“The sastra prescribes sacrifice on special occasions. Such sacrifice is not harmful. Take, for instance, the sacrifice of a goat on the eighth day of the full or new moon.\n“I am now in such a state of mind that I cannot watch a sacrifice. Also I cannot eat meat offered to the Divine Mother. Therefore I first touch my finger to it, then to my head, lest She should be angry with me.\n“Again, in a certain state of mind I see God in all beings, even in an ant. At that time, if I see a living being die, I find consolation in the thought that it is the death of the body, the soul being beyond life and death.\n(\nBG 2.20\n,\nKatha Upanishad 1.2.18\n)\n“One should not reason too much; it is enough if one loves the Lotus Feet of the Mother. Too much reasoning throws the mind into confusion. You get clear water if you drink from the surface of a pool. Put your hand deeper and stir the water, and it becomes muddy. Therefore pray to God for devotion.\n(\nKatha Upanishad 1.2.20\n)\n“Behind Dhruva’s devotion there was desire. He practised austerities to gain his father’s kingdom. But Prahlada’s love for God was motiveless — a love that sought no return.”\nA DEVOTEE:\n“How can one realise God?”\nMASTER:\n“Through that kind of love. But one must force one’s demand on God. One should be able to say: ‘O God, wilt Thou not reveal Thyself to me? I will cut my throat with a knife.’ This is the tamas of bhakti.”\nDEVOTEE:\n“Can one see God?”\nMASTER:\n“Yes,\nsurely\n.\nOne can see both aspects of God — God with form and without form. One can see God with form, the Embodiment of Spirit. Again, God can be directly perceived in a man with a tangible form. Seeing an Incarnation of God is the same as seeing God Himself. God is born on earth as man in every age (\nBG 4.8\n).”\n(Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\n—–\nIt was about half past six in the morning. M. was going to bathe in the Ganges, when suddenly tremors of an earthquake were felt. At once he returned to Sri Ramakrishna’s room. The Master stood in the drawing-room. The devotees stood around him. They were talking about the earthquake. The shaking had been rather violent, and many of the devotees were frightened.\nM:\n“You should all have gone downstairs.”\nMASTER:\n“Such is the fate of the house under whose roof one lives; and still people are so egotistic. (\nTo M\n.) Do you remember the great storm of the month of Aswin?”\nM:\n“Yes, sir. I was very young at that time — nine or ten years old. I was alone in a room while the storm was raging, and I prayed to God.”\nM. was surprised and said to himself: “Why did the Master suddenly ask me about the great storm of Aswin? Does he know that I was alone at that time earnestly praying to God with tears in my eyes? Does he know all this? Has he been protecting me as my guru since my very birth?”\nMASTER:\n“It was quite late in the day at Dakshineswar when the storm broke, but somehow they managed to cook the meals. The trees were uprooted You see, this is the fate of the house one lives in.\n“But when one attains Perfect Knowledge, then one finds that dying and killing are one and the same thing; that is to say, both are unreal. When one is dead, one has not really died; and when one has killed another, the man is not really dead. Both the Lila and the Nitya belong to the same Reality. In one form It is the Absolute, and in another, the Lila. Even though the Lila is destroyed, the Nitya always exists. Water is water, whether it is still or in waves; it is the same water when the waves quiet down.” (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\n—–\nSeeing Rakhal, he said, “Oh, hello! Are you here?” Then, seating himself on a couch, he again lost consciousness of the outer world, and, looking around as if seeing someone, he said: “Hello, Mother! I see that You too have come. How You are showing off in Your Benares sari! Don’t bother me now, please. Sit down and be quiet.”\nThe Master was in a state of intense divine intoxication. In the well-lighted room the Brahmo devotees sat around the Master; Latu, Rakhal, and M. remained near him. He was saying to himself, still filled with divine fervour:\n“The body and the soul! The body was born and it will die. But for the soul there is no death. It is like the betel-nut. When the nut is ripe it does not stick to the shell. But when it is green it is difficult to separate it from the shell. After realizing God, one does not identify oneself any more with the body. Then one knows that body and soul are two different things.”\n(Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\nRelated Articles:\nThe knowing Self is not born; It does not die. It has not sprung from anything; nothing has sprung from It. Birthless, eternal, everlasting and ancient, It is not killed when the body is killed. (\nKatha Upanishad 1.2.18\n)\nThe father said; ‘O Somya, know this: When the self leaves the body, the body surely dies. The self, however, never dies. That which is the subtlest of all is the Self of all this. It is the Truth. It is the Self. That thou art, O Śvetaketu.’ [Śvetaketu then said,] ‘Sir, please explain this to me again.’ ‘Yes, Somya, I will explain it again,’ replied his father. (\nChandogya Upanishad 6.11.3\n)",

We have here a familiar simile to explain a very high vedantic doctrine that the body is just like a garment worn by man and just as these garments are changed from time to time, even so, the Jiva goes on changing the physical body birth after birth. No one grieves when he casts off dirty and torn clothes and puts on other fresh garments. No one grieves when the autumn-withered leaves fall off from the branches. There is always the knowledge that fresh leaves come up with the arrival of spring. The whole of Nature presents such alternate pictures of bareness and beauty according to the changes of seasons. The Lord points out that death is no more than the rejection of the old and decayed body. The Jiva drops off the decayed body by death and adopts a fresh one. So there is absolutely no cause for grief. But of course, to destroy the past karma by supreme jnana, and escape from the cycle of birth and death is the reward of the highest realisation.",

The noble ideal of universal love is the logical corollary from this truth that the Self alone exists everywhere, and in all beings. The seeker has thus to eliminate all sin and uncharitable thoughts and feelings against others by the contemplation of the supreme Self as the Lord of the Universe.\nBecause Atma is all-pervading and universal, there is no question of its moving from one place to another. And so, it is the immoveable (` sthanu’). It is also the ancient (sanatanah). So Sanatana dharma’ would really mean Atma-dharma’. Those who have reached the state of Atma are liberated men, `Jivanmuktahs’ the living-free.\nSwami Vivekananda Says —\nWe would describe the soul in these words: This soul the sword cannot cut, nor the spear pierce; the fire cannot burn nor water melt it; indestructible, omnipresent is this soul. Therefore weep not for it.\n[Source]\nSo then the Hindu believes that he is a spirit. Him the sword cannot pierce — him the fire cannot burn — him the water cannot melt — him the air cannot dry. The Hindu believes that every soul is a circle whose circumference is nowhere, but whose centre is located in the body, and that death means the change of this centre from body to body. Nor is the soul bound by the conditions of matter. In its very essence it is free, unbounded, holy, pure, and perfect.\n[Source]\nAgain, it follows that because the soul is not made of matter, since it is spiritual, it cannot obey the laws of matter, it cannot be judged by the laws of matter. It is, therefore, unconquerable, birthless, deathless, and changeless. “This Self, weapons cannot pierce, nor fire can burn, water cannot wet, nor air can dry up. Changeless, all-pervading, unmoving, immovable, eternal is this Self of man.” We learn according to the Gita and the Vedanta that this individual Self is also vibhu, and according to Kapila, is omnipresent. Of course there are sects in India which hold that the Self is anu, infinitely small; but what they mean is anu in manifestation; its real nature is vibhu, all-pervading.\n[Source]\nYou are all materialists, because you believe that you are the body. If a man gives me a hard punch, I would say I am punched. If he strikes me, I would say I am struck. If I am not the body, why should I say so? It makes no difference if I say I am the spirit. I am the body just now. I have converted myself into matter. That is why I am to renounce the body, to go back to what I really am. I am the spirit — the soul no instrument can pierce, no sword can cut asunder, no fire can burn, no air can dry. Unborn and uncreated, without beginning and without end, deathless, birthless and omnipresent — that is what I am; and all misery comes just because I think this little lump of clay is myself. I am identifying myself with matter and taking all the consequences.\n[Source]\nLet me tell you, strength, strength is what we want. And the first step in getting strength is to uphold the Upanishads, and believe — “I am the Soul”, “Me the sword cannot cut; nor weapons pierce; me the fire cannot burn; me the air cannot dry; I am the Omnipotent, I am the Omniscient.” So repeat these blessed, saving words. Do not say we are weak; we can do anything and everything. What can we not do? Everything can be done by us; we all have the same glorious soul, let us believe in it.\n[Source]\nThe masses have been told all over the world that they are not human beings. They have been so frightened for centuries, till they have nearly become animals. Never were they allowed to hear of the Atman. Let them hear of the Atman — that even the lowest of the low have the Atman within, which never dies and never is born — of Him whom the sword cannot pierce, nor the fire burn, nor the air dry — immortal, without beginning or end, the all-pure, omnipotent, and omnipresent Atman! Let them have faith in themselves.\n[Source]\nThe god went home, and at last found that he was the Self, beyond all thought, one without birth or death, whom the sword cannot pierce or the fire burn, whom the air cannot dry or the water melt, the beginningless and endless, the immovable, the intangible, the omniscient, the omnipotent Being; that It was neither the body nor the mind, but beyond them all. So he was satisfied; but the poor demon did not get the truth, owing to his fondness for the body.\n[Source]",

    "translation": "This self is unknowable by the senses, unthinkable by the mind, and is not subject to any kind of change. Knowing this, you should not grieve.",
    "commentary": "An object made up of gross elements can be seen by the eye. Atma is not such an object. So the eye cannot see it. Since Atma is beyond thought, the mind is powerless to know it, Atma is the eternal substratum that exists after the mind vanishes. When the mind is purified, it merges in the Atma and disappears, and when the mind disappears the whole of the objective world disappears, and only Atma remains in its own state. How then can the mind understand Atma? Moreover, every object in the world goes through six processes of change -birth, growth, etc. Atma is not born, is not subject to death, is changeless and eternal. It is the eternal subject, the seer, It is the eternal witness of the universe. It is the very essence of Existence, Knowledge, and Bliss. It is the final cause of the Universe. Ultimately the Universe dissolves into Atma and it alone remains without a second.\nYou should not grieve:\nThe root cause of all sorrow is man’s ignorance of his real nature, and his identification with the body and mind.\nThus sorrow takes possession of the embodied being. Sorrow (`Soka’) is the direct consequence of ignorance (`Moha’). But when, by the study of the `Sastras’ and by the grace of God and ‘Guru’, man comes to know that he is not the body but the Self (Atma), all sorrow leaves at once. This is the solution to the whole spiritual problem. Man should know and establish himself firmly in the Self. All spiritual practices are intended to pave the way for this blissful consummation. So long as there is the slightest separation between Atma and the individual being, there is scope for fear and sorrow to enter one way or the other. But when the union is complete, then is only bliss and blessedness all around. Lord Krishna exhorts Arjuna to know the Truth and transcend all sorrow and delusion. From this, we understand that the realisation of the Self is the only way to become free from the twin evils of ignorance and sorrow (`Moha and Soka’). Knowledge alone is the pure light to dispel the darkness of samsara.\nRelated Articles:\nBut with these eyes of yours you cannot see Me. I give you a divine eye; behold, now, My sovereign yoga-power.

    "commentary": "In the previous verses, Krishna asked us not to worry about the indestructible spirit. A question may arise: Should one lament the death of (the destructible body of) our near and dear ones at all?\nMighty-armed:\nThe Lord addresses Arjuna as ‘mighty-armed. Arjuna was endowed with great physical strength and energy. But it was of no avail to him in that perplexity situation. His physical strength could not help him in his mental confusion and sorrow. So the Lord suggests that he should acquire spiritual light and knowledge, besides physical strength and energy.\nThe Lord argues out the point from the lower level of ordinary human understanding, in order to comfort Arjuna and lift him up to the higher level of spiritual insight. Even if the Self of man is, constantly born and constantly dies, there is no cause for grief; for, whatever dies takes a fresh birth again. The ordinary man whose insight does not go deep enough to comprehend the eternal Atma, sees that the body dies. When it dies, it should have again a birth. It is the process of endless repetition. So, why grieve when the bodies are destroyed? The Lord knows that mere theoretical affirmation of the immortality of Atma may not be immediately understood by his disciple. So he gives a practical reason which the common man can easily understand.\nBut the practical arguments are mere assumptions of the limited intellect only. Even if it is taken that Atma, like the body, is subject to birth and death and rebirth, there is no need to grieve for the destruction of the body. It follows that it is utter madness to grieve for Atma which is real, deathless, and eternal.",

The Self (Atma) as declared above, is not the body and is not the composition of material elements, and so it has neither birth nor death. So long as man remains in a state of ignorance and identifies with the body, he inevitably passes through the cycle of birth and death. The same man, when he realises his identity with the Self, the procession of birth and death stops for him. The Lord here speaks of the common man who has not understood the secret of his real nature. The purpose of the Lord is to rouse Arjuna from the slough of despondency into which he sank in that hour of test and trial. So He employs every argument both of spiritual Truth and common understanding with equal force and conviction.

    "commentary": "This is a true estimate of all beings in the universe. Their state before their birth is not known. They appear to exist for a period after they are born. And again, they disappear after death. One does not see them before birth and after death. Why do men feel so much when they pass away?\nPeople have no connection with the body before it is born. And they cease all contact with the body after death. Only for a brief interval in the middle period, there is a kind of link. What has not existed in the beginning and what does not exist after the end, though it appears in between the two points, cannot be real. It is non-existence.\nThe whole universe is thus an illusion. This is the drumbeat of Vedanta.\nThe dream world did not exist before the dream. It does not exist after one wakes up from the dream. It exists only while the dream lasts. He knows it to be a tremendous illusion after he wakes up. In the same way, the whole universe and all the pleasures and pains that one experiences are all illusions for the man who has awakened from the dream. They are like the water in the mirage, which to the eye appears clear and beautiful, and which when one investigates disappears at once. Why then all this fear and sorrow, weeping and wailing when the whole thing is an illusion?\nIn this manner, the Lord argues out the issue, and the succession of thoughts so far may be summarised thus.\n1. Atma is eternal. All living beings, the so-called relations and friends are different manifestations of the same indestructible Atma, and so Arjuna should not grieve for them.\n2. Atma is unchanging; one wears and throws away different bodies, as old clothes are discarded and new garments are worn.\n3. Even if it is accepted for the sake of argument, that Atma itself is born and dies, again and again, Arjuna should not grieve for the dead, because they should take birth again.\n4. These bodies did not exist before birth, and so do not exist after death. They appear in between for a brief interval of time only. Therefore they are unreal and illusory. Why then grieve for them?\nSwami Vivekananda Says —\nBeings are unknown to our human senses before birth and after death. It is only in the interim that they are manifest. What is there to grieve about?\n[Source]\nNowadays it is asserted that man is infinitely progressing, forward and forward, and there is no goal of perfection to attain to. Ever approaching, never attaining, whatever that may mean and however wonderful it may be, it is absurd on the face of it. Is there any motion in a straight line? A straight line infinitely projected becomes a circle, it returns to the starting point. You must end where you begin; and as you began in God, you must go back to God.\n[\nSource\n]\nThe threefold\n1\nmodification, O Uddhava, which has come upon you is an illusion, for it only comes in the middle,\n2\nand is not at the beginning and end. When birth and such other things befall it,\n3\nwhat is that to you? For that\n4\nwhich exists at the beginning and end of an unreality, alone persists in the middle.\n( 1 Threefold etc.—Gross, subtle, and causal bodies are meant. 2 Middle—like a snake or garland in the rope. 3 It—refers to “modification” in line 1. 4 That etc.—e.g. the rope in a false perception of snake or garland.) — Srimad Bhagavatam\nWater and a bubble on it are one and the same. The bubble has its birth in the water, floats on it, and is ultimately resolved into it. So also the Jivatman and the Paramatman are one and the same, the difference between them being only one of degree. For one is finite and limited while the other is infinite; one is dependent while the other is independent.\n(Source: The Sayings of Sri Ramakrishna)\nThis entire cosmic manifestation is pervaded by Me in My unmanifest form. All living beings dwell in Me, but I do not dwell in them. (\nBG 9.4\n)\nThere is no end of My divine manifestations, Ο dreaded Arjuna. This is but a partial statement by Me of the multiplicity of My attributes. (\nBG 10.40\n)\nThe Rishi said: Nisumbha was killed and Sumbha lying down on the ground could not bear this insult to his kingly honour. With uncontrollable anger, he cried out at Devi, “O weak and wicked Durga! Do not be proud. You are fighting with the help of somebody else.” The Devi said, “I am alone and single in this world. Who is there other than Me here? See, all these many fighting with you are Myself. Now look at Me.” As soon as Devi uttered these words, all those appearances of many entered into the body of Durga, and there was none but Devi, the Single. Devi again said, “Be calm. I alone with the power of immanence and omnipresence appeared as many but now stand single and have withdrawn myself into Myself.” (Source: Sri Durga Saptashati or The Devi Mahatmya (The Glory of The Divine Mother) by Swami Sivananda)\nAdmin Note: Ocean ana Wave Analogy — Wave was the the ocean, Wave is the Ocean and Wave will be the Ocean.

    "commentary": "Spiritual science does not end with mere theory. It is a practical experience. Only by experience does a man know the Self and understand what it is and how it functions in the practical world. But, for such direct experience, much good should have accumulated in the past, the mind should have been purified and freed from all bad tendencies. Therefore only the man who has long practiced the control of the senses, (` Sama’ and Dama’), and who has gone through many forms of spiritual discipline, is qualified to enter the domain of the Self. Others, though they enquire after the truth, are far away from understanding and realizing it. When the mirror is clear, the image is reflected clearly in it. A pure cloth can easily be dyed with any color. The seed sown in a watered ground soon sprouts into a plant. Even so, when the mind is pure, the Self is reflected in it clearly. But such men of pure mind are rare. So spiritual experience is a rare achievement for any human being. The same idea is expressed in the Katha Upanishad.\nThe man of heroic courage and determination desiring immortality turns the out-going senses and mind inwards and sees the supreme Self.\nThe Self is not an object to be seen or spoken or heard of. It is beyond the senses and mind. It is the subtlest of the subtle. It is hidden in the inmost recesses of the heart. By selfless action, devotion, dispassion, mediation, and such other methods, the heart should first be purified, and the inquiry for the Self should be continued for a long time before the Self is directly perceived. The Lord does not say that no one knows Him. He means only that such men are rare.\nSince the Self is entirely different from any object seen or known, it is looked upon as wonder.\nThe verse may also mean that the speaker, the hearer, and the knower of the Supreme Being are all men of wonder.\nSwami Vivekananda Says —\nSome look at It [the Self] with wonder. Some talk of It as wonderful. Others hear of It as wonderful. Others, hearing of It, do not understand.\n[Source]\nIn the Ramakrishna Incarnation there is knowledge, devotion and love — infinite knowledge, infinite love, infinite work, infinite compassion for all beings. You have not yet been able to understand him. “श्रुत्वाप्येनं वेद न चैव कश्चित् — Even after hearing about Him, most people do not understand Him.” What the whole Hindu race has thought in ages, he lived in one life. His life is the living commentary to the Vedas of all nations. People will come to know him by degrees.\n[Source]\nBut it falleth out, that many who often hear the Gospel of Christ, are yet but little affected, because they are void of the Spirit of Christ. But whosoever would fully and feelingly understand the words of Christ, must endeavour to conform his life wholly to the life of Christ.\n[Source]\n(The Imitation of Christ, V. 2.) (*1)\nSri Ramakrishna Says —\nA BRAHMO DEVOTEE:\n“Sir, has God forms or has He none?”\nMASTER:\n“No one can say with finality that God is only ‘this’ and nothing else. He is formless, and again He has forms. For the bhakta He assumes forms. But He is formless for the jnani, that is, for him who looks on the world as a mere dream. The bhakta feels that he is one entity and the world another. Therefore God, reveals Himself to him as a Person. But the jnani — the Vedantist, for instance — always reasons, applying the process of ‘Not this, not this’. Through this discrimination he realises, by his inner perception, that the ego and the universe are both illusory, like a dream. Then the jnani realises Brahman in his own consciousness. He cannot describe what Brahman is.\n“Do you know what I mean? Think of Brahman, Existence-Knowledge- Bliss Absolute, as a shoreless ocean. Through the cooling influence, as it were, of the bhakta’s love, the water has frozen at places into blocks of ice. In other words, God now and then assumes various forms for His lovers and reveals Himself to them as a Person. But with the rising of the sun of Knowledge, the blocks of ice melt. Then one doesn’t feel any more that God is a Person, nor does one see God’s forms. What He is cannot be described. Who will describe Him? He who would do so disappears. He cannot find his ‘I’ any more.\n“If one analyses oneself, one doesn’t find any such thing as ‘I’. Take an onion, for instance. First of all you peel off the red outer skin; then you find thick white skins. Peel these off one after the other, and you won’t find anything inside.\n“In that state a man no longer finds the existence of his ego. And who is there left to seek it? Who can describe how he feels in that state — in his own Pure Consciousness — about the real nature of Brahman? Once a salt doll went to measure the depth of the ocean. No sooner was it in the water than it melted. Now who was to tell the depth?\n“There is a sign of Perfect Knowledge. Man becomes silent when It is attained. Then the ‘I’, which may be likened to the salt doll, melts in the Ocean of Existence-Knowledge-Bliss Absolute and becomes one with It. Not the slightest trace of distinction is left.\n“As long as his self-analysis is not complete, man argues with much ado. But he becomes silent when he completes it. When the empty pitcher has been filled with water, when the water inside the pitcher becomes one with the water of the lake outside, no more sound is heard. Sound comes from the pitcher as long as the pitcher is not filled with water.\n“People used to say in olden days that no boat returns after having once entered the black waters’ of the ocean.\n“All trouble and botheration come to an end when the ‘I’ dies. You may indulge in thousands of reasonings, but still the ‘I’ doesn’t disappear. For people like you and me, it is good to have the feeling, ‘I am a lover of God.’\n“The Saguna Brahman is meant for the bhaktas. In other words, a bhakta believes that God has attributes and reveals Himself to men as a Person, assuming forms. It is He who listens to our prayers. The prayers that you utter are directed to Him alone. You are bhaktas, not jnanis or Vedantists. It doesn’t matter whether you accept God with form or not. It is enough to feel that God is a Person who listens to our prayers, who creates, preserves, and destroys the universe, and who is endowed with infinite power.\n“It is easier to attain God by following the path of devotion.”\nBRAHMO DEVOTEE:\n“Sir, is it possible for one to see God? If so, why can’t we see Him?”\nMASTER:\n“Yes, He can surely be seen. One can see His forms, and His formless aspect as well. How can I explain that to you?” (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\nMany there are who do not even hear of Atman; though hearing of Him, many do not comprehend. Wonderful is the expounder and rare the hearer; rare indeed is the experiencer of Atman taught by an able preceptor.  (\nKatha Upanishad 1.2.7\n)\n[*1] This passage is the English version of Swami Vivekananda’s translation of The Imitation of Christ (V. 2) into Bengali.

So where is the cause for sorrow ? Sorrow comes only by the false identification of the Self with the body.\nTo think that you are the body is the very source, the very cause of all sorrow and suffering.\nIt is immediately removed when you come to know that you are Atma.

    "commentary": "We understand from this verse how much the Lord loves the performance of one’s own Dharma. One should not waver in discharging his duty. This is the Lord’s command. So long as the body lasts, every being has to do some work or other. This is the inescapable law of our nature. Action being inevitable in the material world, it is necessary for man to do some selfless work, according to his duty, which leads to great good on the physical plane and elsewhere. More so, selfless work purifies the mind and leads ultimately to liberation. It is the duty of a Kshatriya to fight a righteous war. The Lord emphasizes the righteousness of the undertaking. Otherwise, it would be an unrighteous war resulting only in hatred, sorrow, and death, and no merit comes to anyone.\nSwami Vivekananda Says —\nBut if you say that killing all these people is sinful, then consider this from the standpoint of your own caste-duty.\n[Source]",

    "commentary": "Arjuna is here addressed as Partha, the son of Pritha (Kunti). This reminds us of the message that the mother sent to her son on the eve of the battle through Lord Krishna.\n“O Krishna! Tell Arjuna and the battle-minded Bhima that the time has come to justify why a Kshatriya mother desires to have sons.”\nWar against external enemies is the duty prescribed for the Kshatriya. But the internal conflict with bad instincts and impulses, like lust, greed, and hate, is taking place in the heart of every human being.\nThe Kshatriya who fights a righteous war gains a kingdom or Heaven. The man who defeats the external enemies attains\nMoksha\n, liberation (\n‘Moksha dvaram apavrutam’\n). The true warrior is always eager to undertake a righteous war.\nThe spiritual seeker is always ready and alert to fight ignorance in whatever form it may raise its head.\nThe righteous war is not a religious war against the followers of other religions. The righteous war may be waged even against our own evil-doer kith and kin (Rig Veda 6.75.19). Life is a con­tinuous battle between the forces of evil and goodness. A valiant per­son must fight with the spirit of a warrior—with a will and determination for victory—and without any compromise with the forces of evil and difficulties. God helps the valiant who adhere to morality. Dharma (righteousness) protects those who protect Dharma (morality, justice, and righteousness).\nIt is better to die for a right cause and acquire the grace of sacrifice than to die an ordinary but compulsory death. The gates of heaven open wide for those who stand up to vindicate justice and righteousness (Dharma). Not to oppose an evil is to indirectly support it. Very similar ideas are expressed in other scriptures of the world. There is no sin in killing an aggressor. Whosoever helps and supports an aggressor is also an aggressor. Thus, all those who supported Kauravas were basically aggressors and deserved to be eliminated.",

    "translation": "Having an equal mind in pain and pleasure, gain and loss, victory and defeat, engage in battle and thereby you will not incur sin.",
    "commentary": "This is the starting verse of the theory of Karma Yoga, the main theme of the Gita. In this verse, the Lord teaches the secret of Karma Yoga. Though engaged in various types of activity, a man can live without any taint of sin. That secret lies in the balance of mind, equanimity, and detachment. Man should work without losing his equanimity in the vicissitudes of natural change. Success unbalances the mind by a wave of elation, and defeat by a wave of depression.\nThis is what the common man experiences in the course of his life’s activity. The Gita propounds equanimity, as the only cure for these mental waves carrying man from one extreme to another. And these mental disturbances are caused by attachment to the enjoyments of life. The seeker should know that he has nothing to gain or lose by victory or defeat in his endeavors. Thus he would be free from the disturbing emotions of pride, egotism, and elation in success, self-pity in sorrow, and despair in failure.\nWhen the mind is kept in a state of equanimity, Atma is reflected clearly.\nHow can such a man incur sin?\nSome people think that the yoga of work is a lower path and that work binds man to the wheel of birth and death. The Lord denies it. It is not the work that binds, but the attachment to the fruits of work that binds.\nIf a man attaches himself to the fruits of work, then he is bound and he has to take a number of births to enjoy or suffer the effect of his works. On the other hand, if the aspirant knows that he has nothing to seek for in the universe, that he is Atma, then he is indifferent to the results of his work. He is equal-minded. This is the secret of Karma Yoga.\nThen engage in battle:\n‘From this, we understand that before plunging into action, one should know and practice the secret of work. The Lord’s command is ‘then fight’ (i-e.) after attaining equanimity of mind. Otherwise, action immediately binds him to the wheel of birth and death. The ups and downs of worldly life and its reactions will throw the man off the gear into a tormented state of pain and suffering. Perfect knowledge should illumine work. Then work becomes worship. Therefore the Lord first teaches Arjuna in the second discourse (Sankhya Yoga) the highest doctrine of Vedanta (i.e), the indivisibility of the personal man with Paramatma, the immortality of the self, and then, comes down to teach the method of work.\nSwami Vivekananda Says —\n“Making pleasure and misery the same, making success and defeat the same, do thou stand up and fight.”\n[Source]\nWhen I became a sannyasin, I consciously took the step, knowing that this body would have to die of starvation. What of that, I am a beggar. My friends are poor, I love the poor, I welcome poverty. I am glad that I sometimes have to starve. I ask help of none. What is the use? Truth will preach itself, it will not die for the want of the helping hands of me! “Making happiness and misery the same, making success and failure the same, fight thou on.” It is that eternal love, unruffled equanimity under all circumstances, and perfect freedom from jealousy or animosity that will tell. That will tell, nothing else.\n[Source]\nThe wise should wholeheartedly welcome pleasure and pain, joy and sorrow, without becoming discouraged (Mahabharata 12.174.39).\nTwo types of people are happy in this world: those who are completely ignorant and those who are truly wise. All others are unhappy (Mahabharata 12.174.33).",

    "commentary": "This Karma Yoga, performed with discrimination, is a powerful spiritual force. It never goes to waste. When once it is started, good results flow from whatever is done in this Yoga. There is no harm or adverse effect even if it is stopped in the middle. For instance, when we plant a seed in the soil, we should water the soil constantly. Otherwise, the seed is destroyed. Such is not the case with this Yoga. Whatever is done produces its own good results in proper measure and at the proper time. Nothing is lost and no effort is wasted.\nProtects from great fear:-\nEven a little of this Sadhana protects man from great fear. And what is the great fear of man in this world? Death. The cycle of birth and death constitutes Samsara. By the practice of this Yoga, man transcends this awful fear.\nA small spark of fire is capable of spreading and burning up a whole forest; A small ship is capable of taking us over the big ocean. Even so, even a little practice of Karma Yoga protects man from the great ills of life. The seeker need not feel discouraged at all. Though he cannot attain the state of perfection all at once, he should continue this practice, little by little, without intermission. Even it is a piece of worship, or a small mantra – have faith in it and go on doing it as best as you can. This will enable you to cross the ocean of samsara. A bit of medicine, taken with a proper diet, helps a man to overcome a fearful disease.\nThis declaration is the most encouraging assurance of the Lord to all mankind. Generally, the seekers are discouraged by thinking of the obstacles on the path of spiritual life “How can I swim across this mighty inscrutable ocean of samsara? How can I transcend this limitless darkness of ignorance? Alas! I am not a Rishi. I cannot perform painful Tapas. I have no steadiness of mind. How can I be saved ?” Such is the usual train of thought for the majority of the seekers. Such discouraging thoughts are the real obstruction to progress. So the Lord assures all that whatever little they do will yield the best results and they can work wonders by their faith. This is the Lord’s promise. This is the Lord’s hope for mankind.\nSwami Vivekananda Says —\nThere is no danger that you can overdo it. “If you do even a little of it, [this yoga will save you from the terrible round of birth and death].\n[Source]\n)\nWe worship him (Gautama Buddha) as God incarnate, the greatest, the boldest preacher of morality that the world ever saw, the greatest karma-yogi; as disciple of himself, as it were, the same Krishna came to show how to make his (Krishna’s) theories practical. There came once again the same voice that in the Gita preached, “Even the least bit done of this religion saves from great fear.”\n[Source]\nThis is teaching on the practical side. Believe, therefore, in yourselves, and if you want material wealth, work it out; it will come to you. If you want to be intellectual, work it out on the intellectual plane, and intellectual giants you shall be. And if you want to attain to freedom, work it out on the spiritual plane, and free you shall be and shall enter into Nirvana, the Eternal Bliss. But one defect which lay in the Advaita was its being worked out so long on the spiritual plane only, and nowhere else; now the time has come when you have to make it practical. It shall no more be a rahasya, a secret, it shall no more live with monks in cave and forests, and in the Himalayas; it must come down to the daily, everyday life of the people; it shall be worked out in the palace of the king, in the cave of the recluse; it shall be worked out in the cottage of the poor, by the beggar in the street, everywhere; anywhere it can be worked out. Therefore do not fear whether you are a woman or a shudra, for this religion is so great, says Lord Krishna, that even a little of it brings a great amount of good.\n[Source]\nCannot the knowledge, by which is attained even freedom from the bondage of worldly existence, bring ordinary material prosperity? Certainly it can. Freedom, dispassion, renunciation, all these are the very highest ideals, but “स्वल्पमप्यस्य धर्मस्य त्रायते महतो भयात् — Even a little of this dharma saves one from the great fear (of birth and death).” Dualist, qualified-monist, monist, Shaiva, Vaishnava, Shakta, even the Buddhist and the Jain and others — whatever sects have arisen in India — are all at one in this respect that infinite power is latent in this jivatman (individualized soul); from the ant to the perfect man there is the same Atman in all, the difference being only in manifestation. “As a farmer breaks the obstacles (to the course of water)” (Patanjali’s Yoga-Sutra, Kaivalyapada, 3). That power manifests as soon as it gets the opportunity and the right place and time. From the highest god to the meanest grass, the same power is present in all — whether manifested or not. We shall have to call forth that power by going from door to door.\n[Source]\nA very small amount of religious work performed brings a large amount of result. If this statement of the Gita wanted an illustration, I am finding every day the truth of that great saying in my humble life.\n[Source]\nSri Ramakrishna Says —\nSri Ramakrishna:\n“With the realisation of Satchidananda one goes into samadhi. Then duties drop away. Suppose I have been talking about the ostad and he arrives. What need is there of talking about him then? How long does the bee buzz around? So long as it isn’t sitting on a flower. But it will not do for the sadhaka to renounce duties. He should perform his duties, such as worship, japa, meditation, prayer, and pilgrimage.\n“If you see someone engaged in reasoning even after he has realised God, you may liken him to a bee, which also buzzes a little even while sipping honey from a flower.”\nThe Master was highly pleased with the ostad’s music. He said to the musician, “There is a special manifestation of God’s power in a man who has any outstanding gift, such as proficiency in music.” (\nBG 10.41\n)\nMUSICIAN:\n“Sir,\nwhat is the way to realise God?\n“\nMASTER:\n“Bhakti is the one essential thing. To be sure, God exists in all beings. Who, then, is a devotee? He whose mind dwells on God. But this is not possible as long as one has egotism and vanity. The water of God’s grace cannot collect on the high mound of egotism. It runs down. I am a mere machine.\n(\nTo Kedar and the other devotees\n) “God can be realised through all paths. All religions are true. The important thing is to reach the roof. You can reach it by stone stairs or by wooden stairs or by bamboo steps or by a rope. You can also climb up by a bamboo pole.\n“You may say that there are many errors and superstitions in another religion. I should reply: Suppose there are. Every religion has errors. Everyone thinks that his watch alone gives the correct time. It is enough to have yearning for God. It is enough to love Him and feel attracted to Him. Don’t you know that God is the Inner Guide? He sees the longing of our heart and the yearning of our soul. Suppose a man has several sons. The older boys address him distinctly as ‘Baba’ or ‘Papa’, but the babies can at best call him ‘Ba’ or ‘Pa’. Now, will the father be angry with those who address him in this indistinct way? The father knows that they too are calling him, only they cannot pronounce his name well. All children are the same to the father. Likewise, the devotees call on God alone, though by different names. They call on one Person only. God is one, but His names are many.” (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\nRelated Articles:\nVerily these acts should be performed leaving aside attachment (doership) and the fruits; this is my certain and best opinion. (\nBG 18.6\n)\nO Arjuna! Steadfast in Yoga, giving up all attachment, unmindful of success or failure, do your work. Such equanimity of mind is called Yoga. (\nBG 2.48\n)\nThe Lord said: O Pārtha, there is no destruction for him either in this world or the next: no evil, My son, befalls a man who does good. (\nBG 6.40\n)",

    "translation": "O Arjuna! There is only one faith and thought for those who practice this Karma Yoga. The minds of others are divided into various branches, and their thoughts and speculations are endless.",
    "commentary": "Faith in Atma (God) is only one concentrated thought. It seeks for nothing else. It does not disperse itself and spread out like the branches of a tree. Though the man is engaged in a hundred tasks, yet the main affirmation of the mind is only one (i.e.) the universality of the Supreme Self. So in all that he does, his mind is firmly fixed in Atma. He sees the same Atma, in all that he does. This is faith. He surrenders the fruits of his work to God. He has no desire to enjoy anything of the fruits of his work. Those who have not cultivated this single-minded faith, attach their minds to various objects of the world, enjoy them in various ways, and go on hopping from one thing to another just as birds hop from one branch to another in search of leaf or fruit. They have no concentration of mind because they have no faith.\nThe different rays of the sun passing through a concave lens become one, and the heat produced by it is capable of burning up anything. When the rays are separate, they have no such power. In the same way, when the mind becomes one-pointed, it acquires tremendous power. Therefore it is necessary to collect one’s mind and bring it to a focal point. This is possible only when the man is not drawn by the various objects of the world, which he desires to possess and enjoy. So long as man desires worldly objects, there is no rest or peace for him. The only way to acquire such peace is the faith that Atma alone is the real, and everything else is a mere shadow. Having faith in this spiritual truth, the seeker should practice Karma Yoga.\nRelated Articles:\nThe Lord said: Hear, Ο Pārtha, how, with your mind attached to Me, and taking refuge in Me, and practising yoga, you will without any doubt know Me in full.

    "translation": "The first part of the Vedas (Karma Kanda) deal with material things pertaining to the three Gunas. One should transcend the three Gunas, become free from the operation of the pairs of opposites, take refuge in the pure sattvic state, and firmly establish himself in Atma.",
    "commentary": "Deal with things pertaining to the three Gunas:\nThis should be understood from the context to refer only to the Karma kanda of the Vedas. The later parts in Upanishads deal with the Supreme Reality, beyond all conditions and states of mind, though\nhere and there\nreference is made to the rites and rituals of Karma kanda. The material world comprehended by the senses is conditioned by the three Gunas or attributes of the mind. This world so comprehended is very limited, is transitory, and perishable. Atma, which is the seer of all objective phenomena is not conditioned by the gunas. It is beyond them. It is eternally perfect. The bondage of life is only for those who are subject to the influence of the three Gunas. Birth and death, sorrow and suffering, pleasures and enjoyments, all these do not affect the wise man who has rooted himself in Atma. Therefore the Lord exhorts Arjuna to transcend them and hold to the Supreme Self.\nTaking refuge in the pure `Satvic’ state:-\nThe sattva guna mentioned here is not\nmisra satva\nwhich is mixed with the other two attributes, rajas and tamas. To transcend the three Gunas, one should overcome sattva guna also. In the early stages of the sadhana, the satvic state is colored by the inherent rajasic and tamasic qualities. As these later two are slowly eliminated, pure satva (sudha satva) alone remains, when the sadhaka experiences the bliss of Atma. But in the final state of realisation, even this is transcended, and Atma alone, unconditioned and attributeless, remains in its own purity and perfection. The mind which has acquired the power to contemplate the Infinite Atma is called Satva. So says Sage Vasishta. Since it is enjoined, nityasatvasthah, it is imperative that the seeker should hold on to that state always.\nHaving nothing to gain or retain in the world:-\nYoga means the requisition of new things. Kshema means the preservation of the things required. The whole world is engaged in these two things, acquisition and preservation. Wealth, name, position, power, health, children, etc., are the things that man is constantly trying to acquire, and preserving them after they are acquired. The Lord’s injunction here is to give up both these things. For the man who firmly believes that Atma alone is the Reality, there is no such thing to possess or preserve, because Atma is everything and everything is Atma. He has nothing to gain or lose. Most worldly people desire to acquire wealth, possession, beauty, and so on. But who is there who desires to rest in Atma? To rest in Atma is the greatest achievement, and when this is achieved, supreme content descends on the man, and there is no restlessness. So the way to transcend the gunas is to hold on to the Atmic state, with perseverance and determination.\nSwami Vivekananda Says —\n“The Vedas only teach things belonging to the three gunas, to sattva, rajas, and tamas.” The Vedas only teach about things in nature. People cannot think anything they do not see on earth. If they talk about heaven, they think of a king sitting on a throne, of people burning incense. It is all nature, nothing beyond nature. The Vedas, therefore, teach nothing but nature. “Go beyond nature, beyond the dualities of existence, beyond your own consciousness, caring for nothing, neither for good nor for evil.”\n[Source]\n“Go thou beyond the scriptures, because they teach only up to nature, up to the three qualities.” When we go beyond them, we find the harmony, and not before.\n[Source]\nThe greatest name man ever gave to God is Truth. Truth is the fruit of realization; therefore seek it within the soul. Get away from all books and forms and let your soul see its Self. “We are deluded and maddened by books”, Shri Krishna declares. Be beyond the dualities of nature. The moment you think creed and form and ceremony the “be-all” and “end-all”, then you are in bondage. Take part in them to help others, but take care they do not become a bondage.\n[Source]",

    "commentary": "A small well is useful for purposes of drinking and washing. The same use is implicit in the all-filling flood of water. In the same way, all the rewards and enjoyments mentioned in the Karma Kanda of the Vedas are comprehended in the bliss of Brahman. Therefore the knower of Brahman does not care for the desire to fulfilling works mentioned in the Karma Kanda. According to the law ‘fifty is implicit in hundred’ (Sate pamchasat) and according to the truth that in the foot of the elephant the feet of all other animals are comprehended, all the various pleasures and enjoyments are comprehended in the bliss and blessedness of Atma. Therefore the wise man does not hanker after rites and rituals in the hope of enjoyments here or in heaven. It is stated here vijanatah, and so superficial knowledge is not enough, but the deep experience of Atma is necessary for perfect realisation.\nOne who has realized the Supreme Being will not desire the attainment of heaven mentioned as the fruits of performing Vedic rituals. Scriptures, such as the Vedas, are necessary means, but not the end. Scriptures are meant to lead and guide us on the spiritual path. Once the goal is reached, they have served their purpose.\nRamanuja and others also have given a different interpretation to this verse. For the thirsty man, all the water in the well or flood is not necessary. A few glasses will do. For the sick man, all the medicines in the world are not necessary. One or two suitable medicines are enough. For the hungry man, all the food in the world is not necessary. A few handfuls are enough. In the same way, for the wise man, a few practices mentioned in the Vedas leading to Self-knowledge are quite sufficient. By following them he attains the realisation of the Supreme. All the others are not needed for him. In the Vedas, innumerable Mantras, modes of worship, and works are revealed. The seeker may choose what suits him best to destroy the disease of ignorance and reach the goal of liberation. Here the Lord assures the devotee not at all to be discouraged by thinking that he does not know all the injunctions and practices mentioned in the Vedas.\nSrimad Bhagavatam 3.33.7 —\nO how wonderful! However low-born a man might be, if he has Thy name on his lips, he is indeed elevated by that!

    "translation": "You have the right to work only, and not to the fruits of work. Let not the fruit of action be your motive, nor let your attachment be to inaction.",
    "commentary": "The doctrine of Karma Yoga is declared in this verse. Man has a right to work, and not to the fruits of his work. It means that work should be done in a spirit of surrendering the fruits to the Lord. At all times, and under all circumstances, man should keep the mind free from the desire for the fruits of work. Otherwise, the mind cannot be brought to a condition of peace and restfulness, and one-pointed concentration becomes impossible. As a man thinks of the results of work, anxieties and fears rush into the mind. Demons of failure haunt the mind. Difficulties and dangers born of imagination, bar the way to work. The emotions are disturbed by the shame of failure and the frustration of defeat. Mental energy is thus wasted in painful passions, and man’s personality is wrecked on the rocks of anger and hatred. Life becomes miserable. This is the practical experience of every individual in the world. Thus, we see that work prompted by desire is a disturbing and not a purifying factor in spiritual sadhana. Unless the mind is purified, man cannot get a glimpse of the Self. Therefore\nnishkama karma\nis absolutely essential for spiritual realisation.\nLet not your attachment be to inaction:-\nThis should be clearly understood. The Lord’s command is that attachment to the fruits of work should be given up, and not the works. To give up work is a sign of laziness and inaction. It is tamas. It is the negation of spiritual progress. In sleep one does not do anything at all. But sleep is not self-realisation. The walls and polls do not work. They are not philosophers for that reason. Therefore inaction born of tamas should be counteracted in every possible way. The Lord’s command is a hammer blow on all forms of idleness and weakness, which apparently looks like the peace of Jnana. Some people, out of ignorance, spend their time in empty nothingness, imagining that state to be Brahmanishta. Such people fail both in material and spiritual life. It is imperative for them to recognize tamasic inaction as the first enemy in spiritual life. They should wake up from tamas and start doing something good. No one can live without work. Man must do some kind of work or other. Let that work which you do, be done without attachment is the Lord’s command. That will yield the highest fruit of liberation. Nishkama karma is one of the main tenets of the Gita. This is the message which roused Arjuna to the level of heroic action from his present state of despair and delusion.\nThis key verse of the Gita has confused some commentators and common people who interpret it to mean that one should work without expecting a fruit. This would mean that Lord Krishna should not expect Arjuna to understand and follow His teachings! No one can perform action without expecting some result. This verse means that we should not expect only favorable results of our choices and should accept all results as Prasada (Grace) from God. This is called Prasada Buddhi, BuddhiYoga, KarmaYoga and surrendering to His Will. (See also\n18.66\n).\nThe right outlook on life develops when we fully understand that we have the ability to put our best effort into all endeavors, but we cannot pick the results of our work.\nWe have absolutely no control over all the factors that determine the results. The affairs of the world would not run if all were given the power to choose the results of their ac­tions or to satisfy all their desires. One is given the power and the ability to do one’s respective duty in life, but one is not free to choose the desired results. To work without ex­pecting success or good results would be meaningless, but to be fully prepared for the unexpected should be an important part of any plan­ning. Swami Karmananda says: The essence of KarmaYoga is to go to work just to please the creator; mentally re­nounce the fruits of all action; and let God take care of the results. Do your duty in life—to the best of your ability—as God’s personal ser­vant without any regard for the personal enjoyment of the fruits of your work.\nFear of failure, caused by being emotionally attached to the fruits of work, is the greatest impediment to success be­cause it robs efficiency by constantly disturbing equanimity of mind.\nTherefore, duty should be performed with detached attach­ment. Success in any undertaking becomes easier if one works hard without being bothered by the outcome. Work is done more efficiently when the mind is not bothered continuously—consciously or subconsciously—with the outcome, good or bad, of an action. Stress is produced when fruit or goal becomes more important than the work itself due to ego.\nOne has to dis­cover this fact personally in life. A person should work without any mo­tive as a matter of duty for a greater cause of helping human­ity rather than just helping oneself, one’s children, or a few individuals. Equanimity and spiri­tual progress result from selfless service, whereas work with selfish motives create the bonds of Karma as well as great disappointments.\nDedicated selfless service for a greater cause leads to everlasting peace and happiness here and hereafter.\nThe boundary of one’s jurisdiction ends with the completion of duty; it never crosses the garden of fruit. A hunter has control over the arrow only, never over the deer.\nHarry Bhalla says: A farmer has control over how he works his land, yet no control over the harvest. But he cannot expect a harvest if he does not work his land.\nWhen one has no desire for the pleasure of victory, one is not affected by the pain of de­feat.\nQuestions of the pleasure of success or the pain of failure do not arise because a KarmaYogi is always on the path of service without waiting to enjoy the fruit or even the flower of work. He or she has learned to enjoy the joy of service. The myopia of short-term, personal gain, caused by ignorance of metaphysics, is the root of all evils in society and the world. The bird of righteousness cannot be con­fined in the cage of personal gain. Dharma and selfishness cannot stay together.\nThe desire for fruit takes one to the dark alley of sin and prevents one’s real growth. Acting only in one’s own self-interest is sinful. The welfare of the individual lies in the welfare of society. The wise work for all of society, whereas the ig­norant work only for themselves or their children and grandchildren. One who knows the Truth does not let the shadow of personal gain fall on the path of duty. The secret art of living a meaningful life is to be intensely active without any motive, as stated below:\nSwami Vivekananda Says —\n“To work we have the right, but not to the fruits thereof.” Leave the fruits alone. Why care for results? If you wish to help a man, never think what that man’s attitude should be towards you. If you want to do a great or a good work, do not trouble to think what the result will be.\n[Source]\nThe karma-yogi asks why you require any motive to work other than the inborn love of freedom. Be beyond the common worldly motives. “To work you have the right, but not to the fruits thereof.” Man can train himself to know and to practise that, says the karma-yogi. When the idea of doing good becomes a part of his very being, then he will not seek for any motive outside. Let us do good because it is good to do good; he who does good work even in order to get to heaven binds himself down, says the karma-yogi. Any work that is done with any the least selfish motive, instead of making us free, forges one more chain for our feet.\n[Source]\nKrishna did everything but without any attachment; he was in the world, but not of it. “Do all work but without attachment; work for work’s sake, never for yourself.”\n[Source]\nHow hard it is to arrive at this sort of non-attachment! Therefore Krishna shows us the lower ways and methods. The easiest way for everyone is to do [his or her] work and not take the results. It is our desire that binds us. If we take the results of actions, whether good or evil, we will have to bear them. But if we work not for ourselves, but all for the glory of the Lord, the results will take care of themselves. “To work you have the right, but not to the fruits thereof.” The soldier works for no results. He does his duty. If defeat comes, it belongs to the general, not to the soldier. We do our duty for love’s sake — love for the general, love for the Lord.\n[Source]\nWhat is your motive? Are you sure that you are not actuated by greed of gold, by thirst for fame, or power? Are you really sure that you can stand to your ideals, and work on, even if the whole world wants to crush you down? Are you sure you know what you want and will perform your duty, and that alone, even if your life is at stake? Are you sure that you will persevere so long as life endures, so long as there is one pulsation left in the heart? Then you are a real reformer, you are a teacher, a Master, a blessing to mankind. But man is so impatient, so short-sighted! He has not the patience to wait, he has not the power to see. He wants to rule, he wants results immediately. Why? He wants to reap the fruits himself, and does not really care for others. Duty for duty’s sake is not what he wants. “To work you have the right, but not to the fruits thereof,” says Krishna. Why cling to results? Ours are the duties. Let the fruits take care of themselves. But man has no patience. He takes up any scheme. The larger number of would-be reformers all over the world, can be classed under this heading.\n[Source]\n“To be weak is to be miserable”, says Milton. Doing and suffering are inseparably joined. (Often, too, the man who laughs most is the one who suffers most.) “To work you have the right, not to the fruits thereof.” (\n[Source]\nThis world is not for cowards. Do not try to fly. Look not for success or failure. Join yourself to the perfectly unselfish will and work on. Know that the mind which is born to succeed joins itself to a determined will and perseveres. You have the right to work, but do not become so degenerate as to look for results. Work incessantly, but see something behind the work. Even good deeds can find a man in great bondage. Therefore be not bound by good deeds or by desire for name and fame. Those who know this secret pass beyond this round of birth and death and become immortal.\n[Source]\nThose great masterminds producing momentous results in the hearts of mankind were content to write their books without even putting their names, and to die quietly, leaving the books to posterity. Who knows the writers of our philosophy, who knows the writers of our Puranas? They all pass under the generic name of Vyasa, and Kapila, and so on. They have been true children of Shri Krishna. They have been true followers of the Gita; they practically carried out the great mandate, “To work you have the right, but not to the fruits thereof.”\n[Source]\nBy the by, I have made a discovery as to the mental method of really practising what the Gita teaches, of working without an eye to results. I have seen much light on concentration and attention and control of concentration, which if practised will take us out of all anxiety and worry. It is really the science of bottling up our minds whenever we like.\n[Source]\nDespair not; remember the Lord says in the Gita, “To work you have the right, but not to the result.” Gird up your loins, my boy.\n[Source]\nThough the ideal of work of our Brahmavadin should always be “कर्मण्येवाधिकारस्ते मा फलेषु कदाचन — To work thou hast the right, but never to the fruits thereof”, yet no sincere worker passes out of the field of activity without making himself known and catching at least a few rays of light.\n[Source]\nBring all light into the world. Light, bring light! Let light come unto every one; the task will not be finished till every one has reached the Lord. Bring light to the poor; and bring more light to the rich, for they require it more than the poor. Bring light to the ignorant, and more light to the educated, for the vanities of the education of our time are tremendous! Thus bring light to all and leave the rest unto the Lord, for in the words of the same Lord, “To work you have the right and not to the fruits thereof.” “Let not your work produce results for you, and at the same time may you never be without work.”\n[Source]\nLet me remind you again, “Thou hast the right to work but not to the fruits thereof.” Stand firm like a rock. Truth always triumphs. Let the children of Shri Ramakrishna be true to themselves and everything will be all right. We may not live to see the outcome, but as sure as we live, it will come sooner or later. What India wants is a new electric fire to stir up a fresh vigour in the national veins. This was ever, and always will be, slow work. Be content to work, and, above all, be true to yourself.\n[Source]\nThis wonderful national machine has worked through ages, this wonderful river of national life is flowing before us. Who knows, and who dares to say, whether it is good and how it shall move? Thousands of circumstances are crowding round it, giving it a special impulse, making it dull at one time and quicker at another. Who dares command its motion? Ours is only to work, as the Gita says, without looking for results. Feed the national life with the fuel it wants, but the growth is its own; none can dictate its growth to it.\n[Source]\nDeath for the cause is our goal, not success.\n[Source]\nSri Ramakrishna Says —\nMASTER:\n“\nPerform your duties in an unselfish spirit.\nThe work that Vidyasagar is engaged in is very good.\nAlways try to perform your duties without desiring any result.\n“\nM:\n“Yes, sir. But may I know if one can realise God while performing one’s duties? Can ‘Rama’ and ‘desire’ coexist? The other day I read in a Hindi couplet: ‘Where Rama is, there desire cannot be; where desire is, there Rama cannot be.'”\nMASTER:\n“All, without exception, perform work. Even to chant the name and glories of God is work, as is the meditation of the non-dualist on ‘I am He’. Breathing is also an activity. There is no way of renouncing work altogether. So do your work, but surrender the result to God.”\nM:\n“Sir, may I make an effort to earn more money?”\nMASTER:\n“It is permissible to do so to maintain a religious family. You may try to increase your income, but in an honest way. The goal of life is not the earning of money, but the service of God. Money is not harmful if it is devoted to the service of God.”\nM:\n“How long should a man feel obliged to do his duty toward his wife and children?”\nMASTER:\n“As long as they-feel pinched for food and clothing. But one need not take the responsibility of a son when he is able to support himself. When the young fledgling learns to pick its own food, its mother pecks it if it comes to her for food.”\nM:\n“\nHow long must one do one’s duty?\n“\nMASTER:\n“The blossom drops off when the fruit appears. One doesn’t have to do one’s duty after the attainment of God, nor does one feel like doing it then.\n(Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\n—–\nAbout nine o’clock in the morning the Master was seated in his room with Rakhal, M., and a few other devotees. It was the day of the new moon. As usual with him on such days, Sri Ramakrishna entered again and again into communion with the Divine Mother. He said to the devotees: “God alone exists, and all else is unreal. The Divine Mother has kept all deluded by Her maya. Look at men. Most of them are entangled in worldliness. They suffer so much, but still they have the same attachment to ‘woman and gold’. The camel eats thorny shrubs, and blood gushes from its mouth; still it will eat thorns. While suffering pain at the time of delivery, a woman says, ‘Ah’ I shall never go to my husband again.’ But afterwards she forgets.\n“The truth is that no one seeks God. There are people who eat the prickly leaves of the pineapple and not the fruit.”\nDEVOTEE:\n“Sir, why has God put us in the world?”\nMASTER:\n“The world is the field of action. Through action one acquires knowledge. The guru instructs the disciple to perform certain works and refrain from others. Again, he advises the pupil to perform action without desiring the result. The impurity of the mind is destroyed through the performance of duty. It is like getting rid of a disease by means of medicine, under the instruction of a competent physician.\n“Why doesn’t God free us from the world? Ah, He will free us when the disease is cured. He will liberate us from the world when we are through with the enjoyment of ‘woman and gold’. Once a man registers his name in the hospital, he cannot run away. The doctor will not let him go away unless his illness is completely cured.”\n(Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\n—–\nA BRAHMO DEVOTEE:\n“Sir, what is the way?”\nMASTER\n:\n“Attachment to God, or, in other words, love for Him. And secondly, prayer.”\nBRAHMO DEVOTEE:\n“Which one is the way — love or prayer?”\nMASTER:\n“First love, and then prayer.”\nThe Master sang:\nCry to your Mother Syama with a real cry, O mind! And how can She hold Herself from you? How can Syama stay away? . . .\nContinuing, the Master said:\n“And one must always chant the name and glories of God and pray to Him. An old metal pot must be scrubbed every day. What is the use of cleaning it only once? Further, one must practise discrimination and renunciation; one must be conscious of the unreality of the world.”\nBRAHMO:\n“Is it good to renounce the world?”\nMASTER:\n“Not for all. Those who have not yet come to the end of their enjoyments should not renounce the world. Can one get drunk on two annas’ worth of wine?”\nBRAHMO:\n“Then should they lead a worldly life?”\nMASTER:\n“Yes, they should try to perform their duties in a detached way. Before you break the jack-fruit open, rub your hands with oil, so that the sticky milk will not smear them. The maidservant in a rich man’s house performs all her duties, but her mind dwells on her home in the country. This is an example of doing duty in a detached way. You should renounce the world only in mind. But a sannyasi should renounce the world both inwardly and outwardly.” (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\n“Sunu Bharata bhāvī prabala bilakhi kaheu muninātha |\nHāni lābhu jīvanu maranu jasu apajasu bidhi hātha ||”",

    "translation": "O Arjuna! Steadfast in Yoga, giving up all attachment, unmindful of success or failure, do your work. Such equanimity of mind is called Yoga.",
    "commentary": "The Lord’s command is that man should work, having established himself firmly in Yoga. What is Yoga? Equanimity of mind in success and failure is Yoga. The definition of Yoga should be carefully noted. How can one acquire such perfect mental equilibrium? Such a state can be had only when one transcends the mind and enter the Atmic state. That is the yogic position. The merging of the mind in Atma is Yoga. As this state alone can bring about perfect equanimity, the word Yoga is here applied to samatvam (i.e.) equal-mindedness under all circumstances. Free from any kind of desire, realizing one’s unity with Atma, man should work.\nOne should cultivate the habit of remaining steadfast in Atma before plunging into work. Godliness and spirituality should permeate the mind. One should feel his identity with the universal Being. Otherwise, the work he does will bind him to the world. The success and failures, losses and failures of his worldly activities disturb the mind by throwing it up in waves of momentary elation and depression and of pride and despondency. So one should deeply think of the Self and discriminate the real from the unreal. Then only a man can work with real detachment and with a steady mind. That is why the Lord first teaches the yoga of self-realisation and next speaks of Karma Yoga.\nSri Ramakrishna Says —\n“Go forward. A wood-cutter once entered a forest to gather wood. A brahmachari said to him, ‘Go forward.’ He obeyed the injunction and discovered some sandal-wood trees. After a few days he reflected, ‘The holy man asked me to go forward. He didn’t tell me to stop here.’ So he went forward and found a silver-mine. After a few days he went still farther and discovered a gold-mine, and next, mines of diamonds and precious stones. With these he became immensely rich.\n“Through selfless work, love of God grows in the heart. Then, through His grace, one realises Him in course of time. God can be seen. One can talk to Him as I am talking to you.” (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\nKarmaYoga is defined as doing one’s duty while maintaining equanimity under all circumstances.\nPain and pleasure, birth and death, loss and gain, union and separation are inevitable, being under the control of one’s past deeds or Karma, like the coming of day and night. Fools rejoice in prosperity and mourn in adversity, but a KarmaYogi remains tranquil under all circumstances (Tulasi Ramayan 2.149.03-04). The word ‘yoga’ has also been defined in the following verses of the Gita:\n2.50\n,\n2.53\n,\n6.04\n,\n6.08\n,\n6.19\n,\n6.23\n,\n6.29\n,\n6.31\n,\n6.32\n, and\n6.47\n. Any practical technique of understanding the Supreme Reality and uniting with Him is called spiritual practice, or yoga.\nRelated Articles:\nVerily these acts should be performed leaving aside attachment (doership) and the fruits; this is my certain and best opinion. (\nBG 18.6\n)\nIn this, no effort is ever lost and no harm is ever done. Even very little of this dharma saves a man from the Great Fear. (\nBG 2.40\n)",

    "translation": "O Arjuna! Work with attachment is far inferior to\nnishkama karma\n. Therefore seek refuge in desireless action with equanimity of mind. Those who work for fruits and rewards are wrecked.",
    "commentary": "We find that Arjuna is addressed as\nDhanamjaya\nin this and the previous verse. The Lord exhorts him not to be content with worldly wealth and dominion which are perishable stuff but seek and strive for spiritual treasure which is eternal.\nIn the Gita, the term\nbuddhi yoga\nis many times used as an equivalent to jnana yoga. Here the term is used in the sense of the discriminative intellect which makes\nnishkama karma\npossible. Buddhi is nischyatmaka (i.e.) the determining faculty of the pure intellect by which Atma is realised, and freedom from samsara is attained. The mind is polluted by various tendencies (vasanas) which bind man to the pleasures of the objective world and carry him on from birth to birth. The discriminative intellect has the power to order the mind and determine what is right from the spiritual point of view. Therefore take refuge in buddhi is the Lord’s advice. When a man brings into direct operation this faculty of the intellect, the dust and heat of passions raging through the material world are cleared up and the perception of Reality becomes possible. The impure tendencies (vasanas) of the mind create a hundred desires, and the man goes on acting for the fulfillment of these desires. Consequently, the cycle of birth and death continues endlessly for the ignorant man.\nDesireless work is the open gateway to knowledge and liberation. The two types of work -work with desire for enjoyment and work without desire – are at the opposite poles.\nTwo persons may be engaged in the same work. One does it for personal enjoyment and fame, and he misses the true end. Another does it without any personal thought or feeling. He achieves the true aim and becomes free.\nSo the attitude to work is most important whatever may be the actual value of the work. The ignorant people who cannot see this difference in mental attitude are confused because they find the wise and the ignorant doing the same work externally. The Lord condemns the poor souls who are always seeking small rewards for their little work. They are meanspirited and wretched men (Kripanah). They are carried away helplessly and painfully. Those who work only to enjoy the fruits of their labor are unhappy because one has no control over the results. Why should man make himself a wretched play-thing in the hands of nature? Why should he become a toy in the hands of fate to be turned in a whirl of worthless pleasures and bitter sorrows? The Lord wants Arjuna to be a real man and not merely a show-boy in the hands of nature. Being born as men endowed with intellect and discrimination, it is shameful that people should make themselves slaves and bondmen to nature, forgetting the glory and blessedness of their real Self.\n`Seek refuge in the equanimity born of knowledge’. That is the clarion call of the Lord. Through the purified buddhi man attains the supreme.\nSri Ramakrishna Says —\nNarendra and many other devotees were seated on the floor. Girish entered the room and joined them.\nMASTER (\nto Girish\n):\n“I look on Narendra as Atman. I obey him.”\nGIRISH:\n“Is there anyone you don’t obey?”\nMASTER (\nsmiling\n):\n“He has a manly nature and I have the nature of a woman. He is a noble soul and belongs to the realm of the Indivisible Brahman.”\nGirish went out to have a smoke.\nNARENDRA (\nto the Master\n):\n“I had a talk with Girish Ghosh. He is indeed a great man. We talked about you.”\nMASTER:\n“What did you say about me?”\nNARENDRA:\n“That you are illiterate and we are scholars. Oh, we talked in that vein!” (\nLaughter\n.)\nMANI MALLICK (\nto the Master\n):\n“You have become a pundit without reading a book.”\nMASTER (\nto Narendra and the others\n):\n“Let me tell you this: really and truly I don’t feel sorry in the least that I haven’t read the Vedanta or the other scriptures. I know that the essence of the Vedanta is that Brahman alone is real and the world illusory. And what is the essence of the\nGita\n? It is what you get by repeating the word ten times. Then it is reversed into ‘tagi’, which refers to renunciation. The pupil should hear the essence of the scriptures from the guru; then he should practise austerity and devotions. A man needs the letter he has received from home as long as he has not learnt its contents. After reading it, however, he sets out to get the things he has been asked to send. Likewise, what need is there of the scriptures if you know their essence? The next thing is the practice of spiritual discipline.”\nGirish entered the room.\nMASTER (\nto Girish\n):\n“Hello! What were you saying about me? I eat, drink, and make merry.”\nGIRISH:\n“What should we have been saying about you? Are you a holy man?”\nMASTER:\n“No, nothing of the sort. Truly I do not feel I am a holy man.”\nGIRISH:\n“I am not your equal even in joking.”\nMASTER:\n“I once went to Jaygopal Sen’s garden house wearing a red-bordered cloth. Keshab was there. Looking at the red borders Keshab said: ‘What’s this? Such a flash of colour today! Such a display of red borders!’ I said, ‘I have to cast a spell on Keshab; hence this display.'”\nNarendra was going to sing again. Sri Ramakrishna asked M. to take down the tanpura from the wall. Narendra was a long time tuning it. The Master and the devotees became impatient. Binode said, “He will tune it today and sing another day.” (\nLaughter\n.)\nSri Ramakrishna laughed. He said: “I feel like breaking the tanpura to pieces! What is this? Only Tong — tong’! Then he will practise: ‘Tana-nana-nere-num’!” (The sound of a stringed instrument.)\nBHAVANATH:\n“Everybody feels annoyed like this before a musical performance begins.”\nNARENDRA (\nstill tuning\n):\n“If you don’t understand it.”\nMASTER (\nsmiling\n):\n“There! He explains away our complaints!” (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\nSee also:\nBhagavad Gita: Chapter 2, Verse 48\nBhagavad Gita: Chapter 6, Verse 3\nBhagavad Gita: Chapter 10, Verse 10\nBhagavad Gita: Chapter 18, Verse 57",

    "translation": "Wise men endowed with equanimity, having abandoned the fruits of action, go to the abode beyond all sorrow and evil.",
    "commentary": "Manisha\nmeans knowledge. He who possesses discrimination and true knowledge has no concern or use for the fruits of work. It follows that discrimination is necessary to understand the principle of right action. The man who has properly understood the bondage arising from work done with desire and attachment, and the great good arising from doing work without attachment and desire, is alone fit to ascend to the abode of peace and blessedness beyond all evil and sorrow. And through discrimination alone can man work without attachment.\nWhen the mind is purified by\nnishkama karma\n, knowledge of Atma dawns, by which man is permanently released from the cycle of birth and death, caused by Karma. So we understand how Karma Yoga leads to final liberation. Some people may doubt how Karma could lead to liberation. The Lord clears this doubt here. He affirms that the man who practices nishkama karma will certainly attain the pure sorrowless state of absolute freedom (i.e.) Moksha.\nReleased from the bonds of birth and death:\nEvery thoughtful human being is instinctively seeking freedom from the ills of life. The Lord here points out the easiest path. He is addressing all mankind. “O ye bound souls! If you desire freedom from the bondage of samsara, if you seek for the joy and blessedness of spiritual life, do all your duties whatever they are without attachment for the fruits thereof. Surrender them to the Supreme Lord. Your mind will then become pure. Then the knowledge of Atma dawns of its own accord. The moment you experience the Atmic state, you become free and free forever.”\nWhether a person is free from attachment or not is the real test of wisdom. Scholarship, power of speech, expounding the vedic texts – these are for the delight of the learned only. They are of little use unless the man is capable of discriminating the real from the unreal, and rejecting the unreal through ‘Buddhi Yoga’.\nGo to the abode free from sorrow:\nPeople speak of many positions in the world. They say that an emperor holds a high position. They say that Indra is the Lord of Heaven. Though they are in very high positions still the occupants are caught in the wheel of\nsamsara\n. They have birth and death, joy and sorrow pleasure and pain. There is only one state, one position, where there is not the least touch of pain or sorrow, where it is all an ocean of supreme bliss, and that position is the Atma State, the domain of Brahma Jnana. How to attain it? The Lord shows the path here. Do your duty without attachment and desire for the fruits thereof. That is the secret of Karma Yoga and its consummation is Brahmajnana.\nSrimad Bhagavatam 10.14.58\n—\nWhoever adopts the lotus-feet of the Lord, far-famed for its sanctifying power and for its being the refuge of all virtuous men, as the boat for crossing the ocean of Samsara for them that ocean is like a puddle made by a calf‘s hoof. They attain to the Supreme State; they have no fear of downfall.",

    "translation": "When your mind has crossed the mire of delusion, you will achieve indifference regarding things already heard and things yet to be heard.",
    "commentary": "The aim of the human individual is to cross the mire of delusion, the darkness of ignorance. This ignorance and delusion are called in philosophical terminology Maya or nature. Beyond darkness is Atma – the abode of light. The Vedas declare it so – (Thamasastu pare). To reach that realm of light, one has to cross the ocean of darkness and go beyond sorrow and delusion (soka and moha). Through nishkama-karma, through hearing the truth, through concentration and meditation on the truth, one should realise the light of Atma. When he arrives at this state, he is filled with the bliss of Atma and has no further need to hear or think of the sastras. He becomes indifferent to them. One should understand that this is spoken of about men of Self-realisation.\nThe seeker should continue to hear the Truth enshrined in the Vedas and the Sastras till he attains the higher state of direct perception of the Reality.\nMire of delusion:\nThe impure tendencies (vasanas) stagnating in the mind through several births are the mire of delusion. It is the duty of the seeker to purify himself by spiritual practices like nishkama-karma and inquiry into the Self.\nThe Mind Becomes the Guru\nThe power of the guru is a special power of the Divine Mother; this power is either dormant or manifest in each human mind. A spiritual aspirant who is devoted to the guru can therefore reach such a high state that this power manifests within him or her also and begins to explain many hidden truths of spirituality. At that time the aspirant no longer needs anyone else to resolve doubts and problems regarding spiritual matters. Krishna said to Arjuna in the Gita (2:52): “When your mind has crossed the slough of delusion, you will achieve indifference regarding things already heard and things yet to be heard.” The aspirant ultimately attains this state.\nReferring to this state, the Master said: “Finally, the mind becomes the guru or acts as a guru. The human guru imparts the mantra to the ear, and the divine guru transmits the mantra to the soul.” But there is a gulf of difference between that exalted mind and this ordinary mind. In that state the mind is pure and endowed with sattva quality; it has now become an instrument for manifesting God’s divine power. But when the mind is turned away from God, it longs to be engrossed in lust, greed, anger, and so on.\n(Sri Ramakrishna and His Divine Play Vol 3, Sri Ramakrishna as a Guru p 457)\nRelated Articles:\nBhagavad Gita: Chapter 2, Verse 46\nBhagavad Gita: Chapter 7, Verse 2\nThe Story of Svetaketu – Thou Art That – Chandogya Upanishad\nBhagavad Gita: Chapter 10, Verse 42",

    "translation": "When your intellect which is perplexed by hearing the various sastras becomes steady and immovable in ecstatic concentration, then you shall attain union with the Supreme Being.",
    "commentary": "Naturally, the seeker in the initial stages is distracted by the innumerable rites and rituals mentioned in the Vedas for the purpose of acquiring material pleasures and prosperity. The mind is distracted by the impulse of the mind, by the outgoing power of the senses in contact with physical objects. Such distraction is a great obstacle to Self-realisation. By the practice of discrimination and nishkama – karma, these distractions gradually disappear. The mind is then calm and collected because it has then overcome the tendency to run after material things. It is gradually fixed in the Self-state and man experiences the bliss of Self-realisation. That is yoga. Yoga means the union of the individual self with the Supreme Being. The Ego which keeps up the delusion of being a separate entity is merged in its own source (i.e.) Self, and then there remains only one Atma, and not two distinct entities as imagined by the deluded mind. Like a bit of salt being dissolved in the ocean, the Ego dissolves itself in the ocean of Sat-Chit-Anand. Then there is supreme peace of blessedness. Till that consummation the mind is troubled. When yoga takes place, there is no mind or Ego existing separately from the Supreme Being. The mind becomes still and immovable because it has become one with That. Then it is all one indivisible ocean of bliss and blessedness.\nSo long as the mind is unsteady, yoga (union with the Self) cannot happen. That is why the Lord insists on the immovable steadiness of mind (`nischala’, `achala’). If the hand is shaking it is impossible to pass the thread through the eye of the needle. So also, if the mind is split and fragmented, it cannot enter the Atmic plane.\nTherefore the seeker should hear of Atma and endeavor to think and meditate on That. He should listen for a brief while and spend more time in concentration and meditation. That is the way. Moreover, rejecting the objective world as an illusion he should look inside into the fathomless spirit pure, calm, serene, and immovable. The more one practices this inward look, the nearer he moves towards Atma, and furthers away from the superficial distractions of the material world. Thus a moment arrives when the mind gets itself completely dissolved in Atma in samadhi. There is no time limit for this consummation. When the mind becomes perfectly still and motionless and is turned inwards, samadhi is reached, and immediately man attains liberation by the knowledge of his real Self.\nSwami Vivekananda Says —\nWho can work without any attachment? That is the real question. Such a man is the same whether his work succeeds or fails. His heart does not give one false beat even if his whole life-work is burnt to ashes in a moment. “This is the sage who always works for work’s sake without caring for the results. Thus he goes beyond the pain of birth and death. Thus he becomes free.” Then he sees that this attachment is all delusion. The Self can never be attached. … Then he goes beyond all the scriptures and philosophies. If the mind is deluded and pulled into a whirlpool by books and scriptures, what is the good of all these scriptures? One says this, another says that. What book shall you take? Stand alone! See the glory of your own soul, and see that you will have to work. Then you will become a man of firm will.\n[Source]\nThe only way to understand Him and the universe is to go beyond reason, beyond consciousness. “When thou goest beyond the heard and the hearing, the thought and the thinking, then alone wilt thou come to Truth.”\n[Source]\nNon-scriptural reading or reading of different philosophical writings is bound to create confusion.\nRamakrishna said: “One should learn from the scriptures that God alone is real and the world is illusory.”\nA beginner should know that only God is eternal and everything else is temporal. After Self-awareness, one finds God alone has become everything. Everything is His manifestation. He is sport­ing in various forms. In trance, or the superconscious state of mind, the confusion arising from conflicting views ceases, and mental equipoise is attained.\nDifferent schools of thought, cults, systems of phi­losophy, ways of worship, and spiritual practices found in the Vedic culture are different rungs in the ladder of yoga. Such a wide choice of methods does not exist in any other system, religion, or way or life.\nPeople’s tempera­ments are different due to differences in their stages of spiritual development and understanding.\nTherefore, different schools of thought are necessary to suit different individuals, as well as the same individual as he or she grows and de­velops. The highest philosophy of pure monism is the topmost rung of the ladder. The vast majority cannot comprehend it. All schools and cults are necessary. One should not be confused because different methods are not meant to confuse, but one should choose wisely.\nSri Ramakrishna Says —\nSri Ramakrishna was standing still, surrounded by a few devotees, and Narendra was singing. M. had never heard anyone except the Master sing so sweetly. When he looked at Sri Ramakrishna he was struck with wonder; for the Master stood motionless, with eyes transfixed. He seemed not even to breathe. A devotee told M. that the Master was in samadhi. M. had never before seen or heard of such a thing. Silent with wonder, he thought:\n“Is it possible for a man to be so oblivious of the outer world in the consciousness of God? How deep his faith and devotion must be to bring about such a state!”\nNarendra was singing:\nMeditate, O my mind, on the Lord Hari,\nThe Stainless One, Pure Spirit through and through.\nHow peerless is the Light that in Him shines!\nHow soul-bewitching is His wondrous form!\nHow dear is He to all His devotees!\nEver more beauteous in fresh-blossoming love\nThat shames the splendour of a million moons,\nLike lightning gleams the glory of His form,\nRaising erect the hair for very joy.\nThe Master shuddered when this last line was sung. His hair stood on end, and tears of joy streamed down his cheeks. Now and then his lips parted in a smile. Was he seeing the peerless beauty of God, “that shames the splendour of a million moons”? Was this the vision of God, the Essence of Spirit? How much austerity and discipline, how much faith and devotion, must be necessary for such a vision!\nThe song went on:\nWorship His feet in the lotus of your heart;\nWith mind serene and eyes made radiant\nWith heavenly love, behold that matchless sight.\nAgain that bewitching smile. The body motionless as before, the eyes half shut, as if beholding a strange inner vision. (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)",

It is possible for a man to appear outwardly to be in a state of samadhi. But that is only self-deception and deception of the world. We should be able rightly to know whether a person is really a Jivanmukta or not. Arjuna asks the Lord to describe the characteristics of the Jivanmukta so that he could understand who they are and how they live. Of course, man’s character is reflected in his speech and action. The ignorant man is discovered by his tamasic and rajasic qualities and the impurity of his life and work. In the life of jivanmukta, we find peace and purity, divinity and blessedness. So if one observes, and keeps company with a jivanmukta, he would be able to reform his life accordingly and rise above delusion and ignorance.\nMan of steady wisdom and steady intellect (sthitapragnah):\nThese are men of steady wisdom and knowledge (i.e.) men whose mind is firmly established in Atma. The others are of unsteady and infirm wisdom. Their intellect is not purified, nor are their minds rooted in the Self. They are attached to the material world. So the aspirant should follow the footsteps of the sthitaprajna and attain the higher status of spiritual illumination by modeling his life accordingly.\nThis part of the Gita – from 54 to 72 verses describing the qualities of the\nsthitaprajna\nis very important. Mahatma Gandhi used to recite these verses as a spiritual discipline and he has practically acquired that state of steady wisdom by the purity of his discriminative intellect, by his surrender to God, and by his nishkama-karma.",

    "translation": "The Blessed Lord said: When a man renounces completely all the desires of the mind, and when he is fully satisfied with his mind fixed in Atma, then he is declared to be a man of steady wisdom.",
    "commentary": "Many people go to a holy man and ask him, “Revered Sir, when shall we be free from the ills of life ?” The holy man repeats this sloka in response to their appeal. The auspicious moment of liberation from the ills of life is in the hands of each individual. When you have acquired faith in the eternal Self, and when you carry out the precepts of spiritual discipline when the mind is brought to a state of equanimity, and when it is fixed steadily in Atma, that very moment man is liberated and he becomes a jivanmukta. Liberation is a natural process and not a sudden high jump into the spiritual realm. The Sastras and the holy men point the way, and the seeker has to realise the truth by his own self-effort.\nNow, what is that practice which leads to emancipation? Desires should be given up. The Lord uses a strong term\nPrajahati\ninstead of\njahati\n, implying thereby that desires should be given up thoroughly, and again, not simply some desires but all desires, without leaving the least residue in the innermost recesses of the mind. This is the inevitable and universal law. There is no other way. Even if the smallest seed of desire is left in the pit of the mind, it sprouts and grows unconsciously, and there is always the danger of the seeker being driven out of the self-state and once again plunged in the mire of delusion.\nThat is what the sastras say. It is not sufficient to partly give up all desires or totally give up some desires only. All desires should be given up totally for all time.\nDesires lie concealed in the unseen nooks and corners of the mind. They survive in the seed form of mental impressions. Whenever they come into contact with the objects of the material world through the senses, they spring up with subtle and irresistible force and cause samsara. Bondage and delusion are not in the outside world. They are inside the mind. It is here that the spiritual operation should be conducted, and the diseased mind-stuff cut off. The mind is something like a dark cavern that is only partially visible to man. The lamp of discrimination should be lighted, and there should be a thorough search of the vast dark region to find out the last and least living desire and burn it up into ashes. Just as all the small pebbles in grain are sifted and thrown off before food is prepared, just as all the weeds are cleared off when the garden plants are grown, just as all worms, germs, and pests are removed from vegetable plants, even so, all the desires should be carefully searched for and rejected by the seeker.\nThese desires are of very ancient origin, as the darkness in an undiscovered cave is there from time immemorial. They have taken root in the subtle body through innumerable births. They are mental impressions (vasanas). Having established themselves firmly by spreading their roots deep into the subtle body, they cause samsara, the endless cycle of birth and death for man. They should be pulled out along with the roots. Otherwise, some little desire left untouched is capable of causing a birth or even a whole series of births. Particles of fire from a half-extinguished heath is capable of destroying a whole colony of huts. Therefore the Lord here insists on complete renunciation of all desires forever. Towards this final renunciation, inquiry into the Self, discrimination of the real and the unreal, surrender to the Lord, company of holy men, and such other practices should be undertaken by the aspirant. The Lord immediately explains what happens when the mind is purified of all desire-breeding impressions.\nSatisfied with his mind fixed in Atma:\nThis is the consummation of all spiritual practices to be perfectly satisfied in the Self by the self.  When all the desires are cast off, the mind remains quiet in Atma – the very source of all bliss. Fullness of joy – where is it to be found? It is in the Self. Bliss is not outside in the external objective world. One may go on searching for it in earth and sky, in the fourteen worlds up and down inch by inch, he cannot find it, because it is not there. Of what use is it to search for a thing in a place where it is not? And yet, such is the power of maya that man seeks for it, in spite of repeated failures and disappointments – disasters and calamities, in the objective world. The search is carried and birth after birth, till man tired and exhausted by his pursuit of the hare’s horn, may be out of sheer despair, turns inwards into his own Self, and Lo ! the miracle happens, he finds that joy in his own self; that joy and Self are one. The mind is purified, and in the purified mind, the natural and spontaneous bliss of Atma is reflected in a flash. This is the secret of Vedanta. Brahmananda is not a newly manufactured article by the skill and technology of man. It is already there by its own right, already full, unpolluted, and uncontaminated by any material taint. But it is covered up, misunderstood, and muddled up with extraneous things. To remove the impure covering and discover the natural ananda is the aim of Vedanta. Now, the man of discrimination clears up the dust and garbage from his mind and finds that the happiness which he has been seeking from everywhere in the world, is in his own Self. When the outer covering of moss is cleared, pure water is seen. When the dust is cleared off a mirror, it shows a clear reflection. So also, when the impurity of mind in the form of desire is taken away, the seer Atma reveals himself as the pure and perfect Self of man. The search for happiness ends here. So the Lord points out both the aspects of Vedanta-the practice of equanimity and desirelessness and then the goal to be attained. The practice is the renunciation of desire, and the goal is the experience of Atma. The first is Sadhana, and the second is Sadhya. The practice leads to the goal.\nSo the first outstanding quality of the sthitaprajna is untainted and perfect bliss. This is his badge, his flag, the banner of his achievement. He is distinguished from others by this characteristic feature. When we find the ignorant people plunged in fear and sorrow, distracted and restless, he alone remains free and blissful in the midst of the ever-changing spectacle of human life.\nSri Ramakrishna Says —\nMASTER:\n“But after realizing God one finds that He alone has become maya, the universe, and all living beings. This world is no doubt a ‘frame-work of illusion’, unreal as a dream. One feels that way when one discriminates following the process of ‘Not this, not this’. But after the vision of God this very world becomes ‘a mansion of mirth’.\n“What will you gain by the mere study of scriptures? The pundits merely indulge in reasoning.”\nPUNDIT:\n“I hate the idea of being called a pundit.”\nMASTER:\n“That is due to the grace of God. The pundits merely indulge in reasoning. Some have heard of milk and some have drunk milk. After you have the vision of God you will find that everything is Narayana. It is Narayana Himself who has become everything.”\nThe pundit recited a hymn to Narayana. Sri Ramakrishna was overwhelmed with joy.\nPUNDIT (\nquoting from the Gita\n):\n“‘With the heart concentrated by yoga, with the eye of evenness for all things, he beholds the Self in all beings and all beings in the Self.'”\nMASTER:\n“Have you read the\nAdhyatma Ramayana\n?\nPUNDIT:\n“Yes, sir, a little.”\nMASTER:\n“The book is filled with ideas of knowledge and devotion. The life of Savari and the hymn by Ahalya are filled with bhakti.\n“But you must remember one thing: God is very far away from the mind tainted with worldliness.” (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\nAccording to Sri Sarada Devi, desires for knowledge, devotion, and salvation cannot be classed as desires because they are higher desires. One should first replace the lower desires with higher desires and then renounce the highest desires also and be­come absolutely free. It is said that the highest freedom is the freedom from becoming free.\nRelated Articles:\nBut he who rejoices, who is contented, who finds happiness in Atma only, has no work to perform.

    "translation": "He whose mind is not troubled in sorrow, who does not hanker after pleasures and is free from attachment fear and hatred, is called the sage of steady wisdom.",
    "commentary": "The characteristics of\nsthitaprajna\nare further elaborated here.\nMind not troubled in sorrow:\nThe mind of the sthitaprajna is not troubled by the sorrows. disasters and calamities of life. The sun who is far above the storm clouds is not affected by thunder, lightning, and rain. In the same way, pain and pleasure are the natural reactions of the mind to external phenomenon, and Atma being above the mind (i.e.) transcending the mind, is not affected by its modifications. It remains as the witness of the mind, in the same way, as the Sun is just the witness of what is happening in the lower region of the earth. Vasishta explains to Sri Rama that just as arrows cannot powder a mountain, just as the sea-waves cannot move the mountain on the shore, just as the lotus creeper cannot bind an elephant, even so the sorrows and troubles of the world cannot affect the Jivanmukta, the sthitaprajna.\nWho does not hanker after pleasures:\nThe Stitaprajna does not hanker after the pleasures of the body and the senses. He is not thrown off his Self-state when pleasant and delighted things come to him. Pain and pleasure are just two different waves of the mind. One wave is called pleasure and another is called pain. Both are caused by the contact of the mind with external objects. If the object is agreeable, there is a wave of pleasure. If the object is undesirable, there is a wave of pain. The sthitaprajna whose mind is firmly established in Atma is not moved one way or the other when pleasant and unpleasant things occur. The Jivanmukta has found himself one with the ocean of bliss, and as such how can he think of attaching himself to any kind of material pleasure? He knows that these little pleasures are only ripples on the surface of the ocean of bliss and that they are shadowy reflections of his own Self. No one can cling to the pleasures of a dream when he awakens from the dream. If really he desires such pleasures, it only shows that he has not yet fully awakened from the dream. So also, he who clings to worldly pleasures arising from the senses and sense objects is not a Sthitaprajna. Attachment to people, places, and objects takes away the intellect. People are help­lessly tied with the rope of attachment. One has to learn to cut this rope with the sword of knowledge of the Absolute and become detached and free. We have the shining example of Suka, as the Sthitaprajna par excellence. If today we come across a man of such caliber who can look upon pain and pleasure with an equal eye, verily we have to honor him as a Jivanmukta.\nFree from attachment, fear, and hatred:\nAgain, it is pointed out that the Sthitaprajna is free from attachment, fear, and hatred. To the man of knowledge, everything appears as Atma, in the same way as everything appears as material objects to the ignorant man. What then can he desire? Whom can he fear or hate? The same truth is declared in the Esavasya Upanishad also.\nFor the wise man who knows that everything is that one Atma, there can be no delusion and no sorrow. He has realised that all that exists is only the Supreme Self and nothing else. Fear and hatred arise only when there is a second thing. When all this is one indivisible Satchidananda Absolute, where is fear and where is hate? He is himself everything. Can he hate himself? Can he fear himself? No. That is the state of the Jivanmukta, the Sthitaprajna – supreme and transcendental.",

    "translation": "He who has no attachment to anything anywhere, who does not rejoice and hate when good and bad things happen, his wisdom is fixed and steady.",
    "commentary": "In the Gita, we find that the Lord uses the general term yah (anybody) without limiting its scope to any caste or creed, race, or nationality. Anyone who has acquired firmness in the wisdom of the Self is declared to be a Sthitaprajna whoever he is and whatever may be his caste or creed. This is the sign of the universality of the Gita.\nWithout attachment in all things:\nOne should be detached from and indifferent to everything in the world. Of course, no one is attached to unpleasant things. A similar attitude is to be cultivated towards pleasant things also. Things pleasant and unpleasant are both in the domain of Maya, and the Self is beyond Maya, and so these lower modifications do not in any way affect the Self. The sthitaprajna having reached the Self-state is not at all concerned with them. The man of wisdom does not seek anything. And yet, nature brings many things to him, both pleasant and unpleasant in the course of his life. But he neither rejoices nor laments when these things happen of their own accord. He remains immovable like a mountain in a state of perfect equanimity. This is the mark of sthitaprajna. It should be understood that the Lord is not advocating a cowardly spirit desisting from the battlefield of life with all its duties, obligations, and responsibilities. Detachment is not neglect of duty. In fact, Arjuna was confused at first when he thought that he could attain peace by running away from the battlefield and taking up the life of a mendicant.\nThe whole of the Gita is intended to emphasize that the challenge of life should be met with courage, equanimity, and knowledge of the real Self.\nFrustration may put on the garb of detachment. Cowardice may shine under the mask of renunciation. These are the common delusions of a weak mind. The Lord here insists that the good and the bad should be met without elation or depression. The sthitaprajna knows how to live life under all circumstances with mental equipoise and the joy of wisdom.\nTrue spiritualists have a peaceful and happy look on their faces under all circumstances.\n“Who Can Insult Me?” – Swami Saradananda\nAlthough the Ramakrishna Order has never involved itself in politics, the presence of the former revolutionaries brought police surveillance upon the Order. When Atmaprakashananda joined the Udbodhan centre in 1912, the police learned about it and summoned Saradananda and Atmaprakashananda for questioning. The police official did not offer a chair to Saradananda nor speak courteously to him. But Saradananda gently assured the police official that the young men who joined the Order had given up all political activities. While returning to the monastery, Atmaprakashananda said in an aggrieved tone: “Swami, I am extremely sorry. It is for my sake that you have had to put up with an insult unworthy of your position.”\n“Who can insult me?” Saradananda replied. “If my mind does not accept the rudeness, how can I be insulted? Have I kept anything for myself? I have already offered body, mind, and soul at the blessed feet of our Lord, where there cannot be any room for good and bad, honour and dishonour. Be at ease. You need not worry on my behalf.”\n(Source: God Lived with Them)",

    "translation": "When the yogi, like the tortoise drawing back its limbs into its own shell, withdraws all the senses from the sense objects, his wisdom is firmly fixed.",
    "commentary": "For self-realisation (Moksha) control of the senses is essential. When the senses are drawn back from contact with the sense – objects like sound, color, etc., then the intellect is rooted in Atma. The same truth is stated by Patanjali in the sutras\nYogaschittavrittinirodhah, tadadrashtuh svarupe Avasthanum\n. These two sutras are affirmed by the verse. It means that the senses, which by their nature run after worldly objects should be drawn back, and the mind should be centered in Atma. When this is done firmly, and when there is no deviation from the Self, one’s knowledge becomes perfect.\nThis idea is very clearly brought out by means of an illustration. The tortoise withdraws all its limbs into its own shell at the slightest apprehension of danger from outside. Even if the shell is hacked to pieces it would not extend its limbs. The yogi, like the tortoise, should drawback his senses from the objective world, and settle himself in the Self. It is not enough to restrain one of the senses from one set of objects. Of course, if one sense is controlled, it will make the control of the others easy. The yogi should withdraw all the senses from all the worldly objects. That is why the word\nsarvasah\nis used. Even if all the doors are closed except one, through that one door dacoits may enter the house. Even if one window is kept open, a gust of wind from it may extinguish the lamp. So it is absolutely necessary that all the senses should be turned back, and there should be no contact with the external world. It is the sense-organs that make the person aware of the outside world. When they are drawn back there is no external world. In deep sleep, there is no external world because the senses are not functioning. Similarly, the yogi should stop the operation of the senses in his fully conscious state, and then the mind sees the Self within. Sense-restraint is thus the first and foremost of all spiritual disciplines.\nWhen a person learns to control or withdraw the senses from sense objects, as a tortoise retracts its limbs inside its shell in time of danger and cannot be forced to extend its limbs again until the trouble is over, the lamp of Self-knowledge becomes lighted, and one perceives the self-effulgent Supreme Being within. A Self-realized person enjoys the beauty of the world, keeping the senses under complete control like a tortoise. The best way to purify the senses and control them perfectly like a tortoise, is to engage them in the service of God at all times.\nSwami Vivekananda Says —\n“As the tortoise can draw in his legs, and if you strike him, not one foot comes out, even so the sage can draw all his sense-organs inside,” and nothing can force them out. Nothing can shake him, no temptation or anything. Let the universe tumble about him, it does not make one single ripple in his mind.\n[Source]\nAs the tortoise tucks its feet and head inside the shell, and you may kill it and break it in pieces, and yet it will not come out, even so the character of that man who has control over his motives and organs is unchangeably established. He controls his own inner forces, and nothing can draw them out against his will. By this continuous reflex of good thoughts, good impressions moving over the surface of the mind, the tendency for doing good becomes strong, and as the result we feel able to control the indriyas (the sense-organs, the nerve-centres).\n[Source]",

    "translation": "When a man rejects the sense objects by withdrawing the senses, he becomes free from the sense world only. The longing or taste for them still remains in the mind. Even this longing is removed when the self is perceived.",
    "commentary": "An essential secret of spiritual realisation is revealed here.\nRestraining the senses is not alone enough. Direct perception of the Supreme is necessary. No doubt by restraining the senses, the objective world is repelled. But the taste for them remains in the form of subtle tendencies (vasanas) and unless these vasanas are removed steadiness of wisdom is not possible. Latent longing may rush forth when the restraint is relaxed. Even temporary causes like sickness and calamity may bring about a partial rejection of the sense world. But when these external causes pass away, the subtle vasanas break forth with all their original force. Hence the Lord declares that\nonly when the Supreme is perceived, these vasanas are finally destroyed.\nThe destruction of the vasanas, the destruction of the mind, and the direct experience of the self take place simultaneously. In the previous\nverse\n, it is said that by destroying the vasanas, Self-knowledge comes to man and in this verse, it is stated that self-knowledge destroys the vasanas. These are two aspects of the same Truth.\nDestruction of the vasanas is not an easy task. It is the only path to Moksha. If one achieves it, everything is achieved. The innumerable experiences of the past births have taken root in the mind in the form of powerful tendencies, attitudes, and propensities. They work through the senses, and the senses function by contact with the world. The material world provides the widest field of activity and food for the senses. The senses have been accustomed to browsing at will on these delicious pasture lands of material pleasures through many births. To deny them this form of food means restraining the senses and preventing them from contacting the objective world. But this does not solve the problem. The taste for the objects would still be there in the mind; whenever the opportunity arises, the mental tendencies spring forth to grasp the illusory pleasures because their taste is not dead. So the attempt at first is to withdraw the senses from the sense – objects (pratyahara) and next to destroy the taste for them concealed in seed-form in the mind. When the vasanas are destroyed, man attains freedom, and the objective world is then powerless to influence him. It is stated here that direct Self-knowledge alone is capable of destroying the vasanas.\nOne must understand clearly the reality of Atma and the illusory nature of the world. One must hear of Atma often and often. He should think of Atma and contemplate on it frequently and intensely. He should know for certain that the world before his eyes is a painful illusion, that it is full of sorrow and suffering, that there is no permanent joy anywhere else except in Atma, and that Atma alone is the all-pervading substratum of the entire universe. As one thinks and acts on these fundamental truths, his attachment and craving for sense-pleasures become less and less and as they become weaker and weaker, the bliss of self is experienced more and more, till finally the bliss and blessedness of the Self swallow up the universe and converts it into its own element.",

    "translation": "O Arjuna! The turbulent senses carry away the mind even of the learned man though he is striving to control them.",
    "commentary": "Even the learned man, well versed in the Sastras and vedic lore, is merely a play-thing under the power of the mind and the senses. The mind does not easily turn inwards. It is pushed out, as it were, and through the senses attaches itself to the objective world. If this is so in the case of a learned man who has understood the truth intellectually at least, what about the others? Similarly, the turbulent senses defeat and perplex the man who is trying his best to control them. The fate of the man who has not understood this principle can easily be imagined. The senses draw the mind and drive it in different directions. He is restless and distracted. He becomes utterly the slave of the uncontrollable senses. He who should have been the master is turned a slave! That is the unfortunate position in which many live and die.\nEven the pandits, the learned exponents of religion and philosophy, are carried off by the power of the senses and the attractions of the sense world.\nIn the heart of every human being, the struggle between the real and the unreal, between good and evil, is taking place to some extent. As the man tries to get some divine force into himself in this struggle, Maya with all the regiments, spies, fifth columns, is increasing her own forces to neutralize the divine force which the seeker is gathering bit by bit. This verse describes an aspect of the struggle.\nThe seeker should muster greater and greater divine strength by acquiring divine qualities, and then only can be hope to overpower the enemy.\nNo one needs to be discouraged by the power of the senses. Indeed they are powerful. But what of it? The divinity within is far more powerful. If a pin is placed between two magnets the one which has the lesser power can do nothing. So is man placed between the sense world on the one side and the Divine on the other. The Divine is a far greater magnet and finally draws man to Himself. By control (sama and dama) practiced continuously, the necessary power is acquired by the seeker, and ultimately victory is his. No neglect of effort should be allowed to interrupt the practice. The same exhortation is to be found in the next verse.",

So sense-pleasures of any kind will lead to a downright fall from the spiritual aim. This is emphasized again and again by the Lord. That is why the word Sarvani (all) is used frequently verse after verse. In this verse, two practices are mentioned : (1) Control of the senses from running out and attaching themselves to sense objects, and (2) directing the mind towards the Supreme Lord (merging in Atma).\nIt means rejection of the objective world (Drisya) and identification with the subject (Drik).\nBoth practices are necessary. The first practice alone is not enough. In sleep, the senses do not function, and the objective world is not there. And yet there is no knowledge. So identification with the subject (Drik) is essential while rejecting the objective world (Drishya). It is not enough to clear debts; one should acquire some property. Then he is satisfied. Similarly let a man ceaselessly reject the sense-world as it appears and at the same time, let him think of himself as the pure and perfect Atma. Again, the second practice meditating on Atma is no doubt good, but without the first, the seeker is sure to fall off from the high aim.\nSo the two practices should be undertaken simultaneously.",

    "translation": "But the self-controlled man free from attraction and repulsion, with his senses under restraint though moving among objects, attains peace.",
    "commentary": "The man who is able to restrain the senses and control the mind attains peace. He may be using the senses and sense objects for the purpose of sustaining his life, but such work does not befoul the purity and peace of his mind. When the poisonous fangs are pulled out, the serpent is harmless. Similarly, when attraction and repulsion (Raga and Dwesha) are eliminated from the mind, the senses lose their evil power, and then they are only instruments in the hands of man to do what he wants them to do, or to remain quiet in their places. Such a man can move freely in the world and no harm comes to him. When the horses are well under control, the charioteer feels free and happy because they take him easily to the destination without trouble and danger. So the senses help and not hinder the man who has obtained control over the mind.\nSelf-restrained, self-controlled:\nSelf-control is the necessary condition for Self-realisation. Without it, spiritual life is not possible. The mind and the senses should be under one’s own control, and not he under their control. The deluded self of the common man consists of turbulent senses, sensual impulses of the mind, and animal instincts of hunger, fear, lust, etc. So man acts under the power and instigation of the mind and the senses. They have mastered him, and he is their slave. Man should regain his mastery over himself. Without self-mastery, no man can attain peace and happiness. He may have all the wealth and power in the world, he may have all the desires fulfilled, but the peace he cannot have because\npeace is the reward of self-mastery\n. It cannot be purchased with wealth and power. The Lord points out the way to peace. Control of the senses, purification of mind – these two conditions should be fulfilled first before man could experience the bliss of Atma.\nSri Ramakrishna Says —\nNEIGHBOUR:\n“Sir, is it ever possible to realise God while leading the life of a householder?”\nMASTER:\n“Certainly. But as I said just now, one must live in holy company and pray unceasingly. One should weep for God. When the impurities of the mind are thus washed away, one realises God. The mind is like a needle covered with mud, and God is like a magnet. The needle cannot be united with the magnet unless it is free from mud. Tears wash away the mud, which is nothing but lust, anger, greed, and other evil tendencies, and the inclination to worldly enjoyments as well. As soon as the mud is washed away, the magnet attracts the needle, that is to say, man realises God. Only the pure in heart see God. A fever patient has an excess of the watery element in his system. What can quinine do for him unless that is removed?”\n“Why shouldn’t one realise God while living in the world? But, as I said, one must live in holy company, pray to God, weeping for His grace, and now and then go into solitude. Unless the plants on a foot-path are protected at first by fences, they are destroyed by cattle.” (\nBG 2.62-63\n,\nBG 2.64\n)\nNEIGHBOUR:\n“Then householders, too, will have the vision of God, won’t they?”\nMASTER:\n“Everybody will surely be liberated. But one should follow the instructions of the guru; if one follows a devious path, one will suffer in trying to retrace one’s steps. It takes a long time to achieve liberation. A man may fail to obtain it in this life. Perhaps he will realise God only after many births. Sages like Janaka performed worldly duties. They performed them, bearing God in their minds, as a dancing-girl dances, keeping jars or trays on her head. Haven’t you seen how the women in northwest India walk, talking and laughing while carrying water-pitchers on their heads?” (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\n—–\nShivanath vehemently criticized the Master for his other-worldly attitude toward his wife. He writes: “Ramakrishna was practically separated from his wife, who lived in her village home. One day when I was complaining to some friends about the virtual widowhood of his wife, he drew me to one side and whispered in my ear: ‘Why do you complain? It is no longer possible; it is all dead and gone.’ Another day as I was inveighing against this part of his teaching, and also declaring that our program of work in the Brāhmo Samāj includes women, that ours is a social and domestic religion, and that we want to give education and social liberty to women, the saint became very much excited, as was his way when anything against his settled conviction was asserted—a trait we so much liked in him—and exclaimed, ‘Go, thou fool, go and perish in the pit that your women will dig for you.’ Then he glared at me and said: ‘What does a gardener do with a young plant? Does he not surround it with a fence, to protect it from goats and cattle? And when the young plant has grown up into a tree and it can no longer be injured by cattle, does he not remove the fence and let the tree grow freely?’ I replied, ‘Yes, that is the custom with gardeners.’ Then he remarked, ‘Do the same in your spiritual life; become strong, be full-grown; then you may seek them.’ To which I replied, ‘I don’t agree with you in thinking that women’s work is like that of cattle, destructive; they are our associates and helpers in our spiritual struggles and social progress’—a view with which he could not agree, and he marked his dissent by shaking his head. Then referring to the lateness of the hour he jocularly remarked, ‘It is time for you to depart; take care, do not be late; otherwise your woman will not admit you into her room.’ This evoked hearty laughter.” (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna/Introduction\n)\n—–\n‘If you practise spiritual discipline for some time in a solitary place, you will find that your mind has become strong, and then you can live in any place or society without being in the least affected by it. When the plant is tender, it should be hedged around. But when it has grown big, not even cows and goats can injure it. Spiritual practices in a solitary place are essential.’ — Sri Sarada Devi (Source: Teachings of Sri Sarada Devi – The Holy Mother)\nSwami Turiyananda: “If one lives a good, moral life, one can live in any country, not to speak of India. The whole earth is the Lord’s, where is there any obstruction (Atak) in it for anybody? He only who has scruples in his mind meets with obstructions outside.’ …\n“Let me tell you a short story. While Râma and Lakshmana were wandering in the Dandaka forest after Sitâ had been stolen, they saw a delightful place. Wishing to spend the four months of the rainy season there, Râma said to Lakshmana, ‘Brother, just go and look if there is anybody about. Without the owner’s permission how can we stay here?’ Lakshmana searching hither and thither in the forest came across a Shiva temple, but found no trace of men. On his coming back and reporting the matter to Râma, the latter said, ‘It is excellent, Shiva is the presiding deity of the place. Go and get His permission.’ In pursuance of the order Lakshmana went to the temple and asked for the permission, when there emerged from the image of Shiva a radiant being who went on dancing for some minutes in a wonderful posture, and then disappeared. Lakshmana, unable to make any meaning out of it, came back bewildered and reported all that had happened. Hearing it Râma said, ‘Build the hut. We have got the permission.’ ‘How is that? asked Lakshmana. Râma replied, ‘Keeping the palate and the sexual instinct under control, you may live happily not only here, but anywhere you like.’\n“Every creature on earth seeks the satis-faction of the palate and the sexual instinct. To one who gives up the craving for these, of what avail is anything in this world ?’\n“Well, the whole trouble is due to these-the palate and the sexual instinct. In the Himalayas there are lots of solitary places suited for spiritual practices, but why can’t monks live there? Owing to the urge of the tongue. The craving for delicacies drives them out of those places. And why is it that monks cannot live in peace at one place? Either they have a rude tongue and quarrel with others, or they hanker after dainty dishes, or it is the sexual instinct. Hence if a monk can live at a place peacefully for twelve years, he is said to have ‘perfected his seat’. A twelve years’ restraint is not a joke!\n“All trouble is over if the palate and sex impulse are conquered. When Shri Chaitanya went to Keshava Bharati for initiation into Sannyasa, the latter remarked, ‘You are in the bloom of youth and so surpassingly handsome. Who will be bold enough to initiate you into Sannyasa? Shri Chaitanya replied, ‘Sir, you usually examine an aspirant before conferring Sannyasa on him. If you find me qualified, you will naturally be inclined to initiate me also. So please examine me and see if I am fit for it.’ Bharati said to Shri Chaitanya, ‘Put out your tongue. On the disciple’s putting out his tongue, the Guru (teacher) put some sugar on it. The sugar was left as it was, without being moistened in the least, and was scattered in the air the moment it was blown out. There was no more need to examine the sexual instinct.\n“A man who has controlled all other senses except the palate is not to be considered a master of his senses. When the hankering of the palate is controlled, everything else is controlled.” (Srimad Bhagavata 11.8.21)\n“When the palate is controlled the sex impulse is also controlled. Unless the senses are brought under control there cannot be any spiritual progress. Throughout the Gitâ there is repeated mention of this : ‘Therefore, O best of the Bharatas, control thou the senses first, and thereby kill this sinful propensity of lust, which destroys one’s Knowledge and Realization.’\n“Even if a single organ remains uncontrolled, all austerities, all efforts after spirituality become useless even as when there is a single hole in a pitcher, all the water escapes through that. (\nBG 2.67\n) You know that parable of Shri Rama-krishna, of the peasant irrigating his field. All the water escaped through a subterranean passage and not a drop of water reached the field!\n“Even if a single organ is allowed to run out, that alone destroys the aspirant’s illumination, like water from a cracked leathern jar.”(\nBG 2.67\n& Manu 2.99) रसोऽप्यस्य परं दृष्ट्वा निवर्तते – ‘Even the craving for sense-objects leaves an aspirant when he realizes the Lord.’ (\nBG 2.59\n) Control of the senses is not to be brought about by a violent effort. Only by realizing Him is it perfectly achieved. But at first one must struggle for this end. After-wards it becomes quite natural. Still one should not be over-confident. Just as the intelligent hunter catches a deer and ties it up, so after succeeding in controlling the organs one should be alert, and continue to hold the mind and organs in check.\n“(Pointing to the young visitor) He appears to be a lad who is practising Sadhanas. Don’t you all detect this? I see it quite clearly. One test of the steadiness of mind is the steadiness of look. As soon as the mind gets steady the look also gets steady. No more is there any restiveness in one’s looks and movements. (Source: Spiritual Talks by the First Disciples of Sri Ramakrishna)",

    "translation": "When a man attains peace, all sorrow and suffering caused by the unbalanced mind and rebellious senses come to an end. By peace and purity, the mind is soon fixed in the Self.",
    "commentary": "Every individual is seeking for the elimination of sorrow, and the attainment of peace. How can he get them? The path is shown here. By purity and peace of mind, both are acquired. When the mind is freed from impure impulses the aim of spiritual life is achieved. Just as in a clean mirror the reflection is perfectly clear, even so in the purified mind the Self shines forth in its own splendor and glory.\nSage Vasishta states that purity of mind arising from the deep knowledge of Atma is Moksha (liberation). So all those who desire Moksha should keep the mind pure by constant inquiry of the Self. Two great benefits are derived from the peace of mind – (1) Elimination of all sorrow and suffering, (2) Resting of the mind firmly in Atma.\nOf all sufferings:\nAll sorrows and sufferings – (adhyatmika, adhibhautika, adhidaivika) -are removed at once when peace is attained. What a wonderful boon of peace for man! What more does a man want? A casual look at the world and humanity would reveal the horrid restlessness, distraction, and pain, both of the body and mind, which man is undergoing in this earthly life. Life is a fitful fever. Mad and delirious, man runs here and there, getting and spending, exhausting his energies, angry, distressed, and subject to the innumerable shocks of life. That is the unfortunate state of man. From all these evils man is protected by the contemplation of the Self and when peace is attained, these are completely eliminated. Peace is the condition of Moksha. If peace does not fill the whole being of man, Moksha remains only in intellectual concept without real meaning or substance in it.\nMind is firmly fixed in Atma:\nWhen the mind is untroubled and peaceful the intellect is easily fixed in Atma. Then it is all bliss and blessedness. It is like a small river emptying itself into the ocean and becoming one with it. Even the happiness of the creator Brahma is only a drop in the ocean of the bliss of the Supreme Self. What more does a man want than to merge himself in the ocean of bliss? So let every man who is punished with sorrow and suffering by his own evil, know the path of liberation, and strive for peace.",

This peace is attained by constant meditation on the Self. And meditation is possible only when the mind is in a state of balance and harmony. So the first stage is harmony and balance of mind.\nSuch balance and harmony are the immediate results of the purified mind. It has already been pointed out that a mind free from attraction and repulsion comes to be harmonized in yoga. So without purity, there is frequent mental agitation which makes it impossible for man to meditate on Alma. Through purity, mental harmony is acquired, through harmony the power of meditation is acquired, and through meditation peace, and through peace, happiness. The negative form of the ideas and interrogation at the end proves that the Lord wants to emphasize these ideas for the guidance of the seeker. Peace is an important step for self-realisation.",

    "translation": "As a strong wind sweeps away a boat on the water, even one of the senses on which the mind focuses can carry away the discrimination.",
    "commentary": "The seeker should have dispassion towards sense objects like color, sound, form, etc. If the senses are allowed freely to wander in the wilderness of the objective world, there is a great danger. The mind functions through the senses which are constantly in contact with material objects. The mind by its own impurities prompts the senses to seek enjoyment in the objective world. The mind follows the senses and is carried away in various ways. A simile is used to illustrate the idea. The gale carries away the ship on the waters. The ship may capsize by the gale or otherwise be damaged and lost. Likewise, the mind is driven away from Atma and wrecked on the rocks of sensual pleasures. Even a single sense-organ is capable of pulling away the mind from the spiritual goal. If all the senses rebel, what should be the fate of the man?\nTherefore the mind should be trained to think of the Self and to discriminate between the real and the unreal. If the mind is trained in this way, it can resist the temptation caused by the senses. Otherwise, the mind runs after the senses. The eye sees an attractive object and the mind thinks of it. The power of discrimination is lost. When the intellect yields to the glamour of the mind, man becomes a slave to the material world. So the seeker should carefully preserve his power of discrimination and spiritual attitude, by shutting out the objective world as much as possible. We come across instances of spiritual aspirants suddenly lapsing into sense-pleasures and ruining their chances of ultimate victory. By some amount of practice, they acquire a little steadiness of mind and experience a little peace, but then, by their own negligence, they allow the senses to touch some material object, and the whole process of degradation starts. The mind is like a rubber ball. If the ball is let down on the top of the staircase, it rolls down step by step till it falls on the ground. The seeker therefore should not relax his vigilance even for a moment till the final goal is reached.\nSwami Vivekananda Says —\nWhensoever a man desireth anything inordinately, he becometh presently disquieted in himself.\n[Source]\nSri Ramakrishna Says —\nSri Ramakrishna: “If you move about in a room filled with soot, you will soil your body, however slightly, no matter how clever you may be. I have seen householder devotees filled with spiritual emotion while performing their daily worship wearing their silk clothes. They maintain that attitude even until they take their refreshments after the worship. But afterwards they become their old selves again. They display their rajasic and tamasic natures. (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\n—–\nSri Ramakrishna: “You may ask, ‘Is there any difference between the realisations of two jnanis, one a householder and the other a monk?’ The reply is that the two belong to one class. Both of them are jnanis, they have the same experience. But a householder jnani has reason to fear. He cannot altogether get rid of his fear as long as he is to live in the midst of ‘woman and gold’. If you constantly live in a room full of soot, you are sure to soil your body, be it ever so little, no matter how clever you may be.  (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\nharati\nand\nprajñām\nare the keywords here. Prajñā, we saw, is steady intelligence. The Knowledge ‘I am the Self’ is prajñā. “prajñānam is Brahman,” says the Upanishad. Pure Awareness, which is the import of the ‘I’, is prajñā. In the process of Self-inquiry, the ‘I’ is segregated from the body, senses, prāṇa, mind and intellect and is experienced as pure Awareness. This is prajñā. Whenever we indulge in body-based sensory pleasures, we affirm to ourselves, ‘I am the body’. How is it possible for the body-less Awareness to stay in this prison house of contradictory knowledge? When the mind follows the senses and starts collecting sensory rubbish through them, it loses its prāṇa-śakti—vitality—to meditate and becomes dull. Very soon, it abducts the awareness of the Self accrued through meditation. Here, the prajñā has not become steady. ….\n…..There is a point to be noted here. When the mind follows the senses, it affects the intellect. Here the senses are not said to be the cause of the fall of the intellect; but the mind is. This is because it is the mind that acts through the senses, and it is subtler than the senses. Although the mind is inferior to the intellect, the blemishes of the mind will certainly influence the intellect. The intellect too follows the mind, falls to the plane of the senses, and gets scattered in the objects. This is how the fall occurs—the senses affect the mind, and the mind affects the intellect. Thus, if the intellect fails to steer the mind as a good helmsman would, the mind will get tossed about in all the tidal waves that arise in the ocean of life. Such a mind will create havoc in the sensory plane.\n(Source: Srimad Bhagavad Gita – Elixir of Eternal Wisdom)",

Knowledge should be steady and firm and not wavering and flickering like a lamp placed in the open. Any gust of wind may extinguish it. So are the senses. The little lamp of wisdom is put out by the power of the roving senses, and the attractions of the sense-world. The senses should be withdrawn from the sense objects. The mind should be turned within to look into the Self. There is no use in lamenting that life is full of sorrow and suffering. The Lord is addressing such miserable mortals and is exhorting men to take to spiritual practices and overcome sorrow and delusion.",

    "translation": "That which is, night to all beings, in it the sage is awake; where all beings are awake, that is the night for the sage who sees (the Self).",
    "commentary": "For the common man, the Self-state appears like night, because he can see nothing beyond the senses and the sense-world. What the common man calls day and wakefulness is simply the functioning of the senses in the material world. But it is not so for the yogi who is one with the light of Atma. For him, the senses and the sense-world are not there, but he is fully wakeful in his experience of the Self. So what is a night for the common man, is real wakefulness for the self-controlled. Similarly being awake only in the infinite light of Atma, seeing nothing of the objective world, the yogi finds night in the day when all beings are awake to the diversity of the objective world.\nFor the Yogi who sees the Self, the objective world does not exist, and so it is night. For the common man who sees the world, the Self does not appear and so it is a night for him.\nSo the experience of the sage and the common man are at the opposite poles. The man of knowledge knows that the objective world is like a dream, appearing to exist, but really non-existent. He is therefore utterly indifferent to the avocations of worldly life from day-to-day. He has developed intense dispassion and so the sense-world has no meaning for him. He does not recognize its existence. So sense-world is all night and sleep for him. But for the ignorant, the objective world is the only reality. To them, this is all. day and wakefulness.\nSelf-Controlled:\nThe aspirant who has perfected self-restraint is mentioned here as the one capable of perceiving the self, without the distractions of the sense-world.\nThe sage who realises the Self:\nThere may be many meditating on the Self, but only a few could have a direct vision. It is made quite clear that the direct experience of Brahman is the goal of all spiritual sadhana and the Muni obtains it by long and continuous absorption in Reality. But the total rejection of the sense-world can only open the vision of the Supreme. Again and again, the Lord reiterates the need for self-restraint and self-control.\nSwami Vivekananda Says —\n“Where it is dark night for the [sense-bound] world, the self-controlled [man] is awake. It is daylight for him. … And where the world is awake, the sage sleeps.” Where is the world awake? In the senses. People want to eat and drink and have children, and then they die a dog’s death. … They are always awake for the senses. Even their religion is just for that. They invent a God to help them, to give them more women, more money, more children — never a God to help them become more godlike! “Where the whole world is awake, the sage sleeps. But where the ignorant are asleep, there the sage keeps awake” — in the world of light where man looks upon himself not as a bird, not as an animal, not as a body, but as infinite spirit, deathless, immortal. There, where the ignorant are asleep, and do not have time, nor intellect, nor power to understand, there the sage is awake. That is daylight for him.\n[Source]\n)\n“Where the world is awake, there the man of self-control is sleeping. Where the world sleeps, there he is waking.” May even the dust of the world never touch you, for, after all the poets may say, it is only a piece of carrion covered over with garlands. Touch it not — if you can.\n[Source]\nThe end and aim of yoga is to realize God. To do this we must go beyond relative knowledge, go beyond the sense-world. The world is awake to the senses, the children of the Lord are asleep on that plane. The world is asleep to the Eternal, the children of the Lord are awake in that realm. These are the sons of God. There is but one way to control the senses — to see Him who is the Reality in the universe. Then and only then can we really conquer our senses.\n[Source]",

He does not recognize them as anything other than the bliss of Self-realisation. He may be put in a palace surrounded by all earthy pleasures. And yet he is indifferent to them. He knows only one Reality one happiness, in which everything is dissolved as all the waters are absorbed by the ocean. Similarly, the sage may be placed on the most painful circumstances and yet he knows only one Reality and one happiness (Ananda). The pain also merges into the same reality and disappears.\nThe Jnani has dispassion towards the pleasures of the material world. If there is the least trace of desire for this or that, he is still not a sage. The real Jnani is like the ocean, vast, and full. He is filled with the bliss of Brahmananda. And just as the ocean is full and immovable, the Jnani is firm, immovable, and changeless, in all the states and conditions of life. Small wells, tanks, and reservoirs are not like the ocean. When floods come, they overflow, cut the bund and cause damage. When there is drought, they dry up and look like empty pits. They change. But the ocean is changeless. The ignorant man is upset one way or the other by the pleasures and sufferings of life. They are distracted both when pleasures come, and when suffering falls to their lot.\nThe ocean does not seek for augmenting its water from rains and rivers. They come and the ocean simply absorbs them. That is all. The Jnani also does not seek anything. When Providence brings pleasures, he absorbs them into his own Brahmananda and remains unaffected.\nSo those who desire peace should constantly meditate on the last line of this verse. They should root out all the secret desires from their heart and fix their mind in the one Reality and the one Bliss that exists everywhere. The seeker should be desireless (akamakami).\nSwami Vivekananda Says —\n“As all the rivers of the world constantly pour their waters into the ocean, but the ocean’s grand, majestic nature remains undisturbed and unchanged, so even though all the senses bring in sensations from nature, the ocean-like heart of the sage knows no disturbance, knows no fear.” Let miseries come in millions of rivers and happiness in hundreds! I am no slave to misery! I am no slave to happiness!\n[Source]\nSri Ramakrishna Says —\nMaster (\nTo Vijay\n):\nWhy don’t you come here now as frequently as before?”\nVIJAY:\n“Sir, I wish to very much, but I am not free. I have accepted work in the Brahmo Samaj.”\nMASTER:\n“It is ‘woman and gold’ that binds man and robs him of his freedom. It is woman that creates the need for gold. For woman one man becomes the slave of another, and so loses his freedom. Then he cannot act as he likes.\n“The priests in the temple of Govindaji at Jaipur were celibates at first, and at that time they had fiery natures. Once the King of Jaipur sent for them, but they didn’t obey him. They said to the messenger, ‘Ask the king to come to see us.’ After consultation, the king and his ministers arranged marriages for them. From then on the king didn’t have to send for them. They would come to him of themselves and say: ‘Your Majesty, we have come with our blessings. Here are the sacred flowers of the temple. Deign to accept them.’ They came to the palace, for now they always wanted money for one thing or another: the building of a house, the rice-taking ceremony of their babies, or the rituals connected with the beginning of their children’s education.\n“There is the story of the twelve hundred nedas (Literally, “shaven-headed”. Among the Vaishnava devotees, those who renounce the world shave their heads.) and thirteen hundred nedis. (Vaishnava nuns.) Virabhadra, the son of Nityananda Goswami, had thirteen hundred ‘shaven-headed’ disciples. They attained great spiritual powers. That alarmed their teacher. ‘My disciples have acquired great spiritual powers’, thought Virabhadra. ‘Whatever they say to people will come to pass. Wherever they go they may create alarming situations; for people offending them unwittingly will come to grief.’ Thinking thus, Virabhadra one day called them to him and said, ‘See me after performing your daily devotions on the bank of the Ganges.’ These disciples had such a high spiritual nature that, while meditating, they would go into samadhi and be unaware of the river water flowing over their heads during the flood-tide. Then the ebb-tide would come and still they would remain absorbed in meditation.\n“Now, one hundred of these disciples had anticipated what their teacher would ask of them. Lest they should have to disobey his injunctions, they had quickly disappeared from the place before he summoned them. So they did not go to Virabhadra with the others. The remaining twelve hundred disciples went to the teacher after finishing their meditation. Virabhadra said to them: ‘These thirteen hundred nuns will serve you. I ask you to marry them.’ ‘As you please, revered sir’, they said. ‘But one hundred of us have gone away.’ Thenceforth each of these twelve hundred disciples had a wife. Consequently they all lost their spiritual power. Their austerities did not have their original fire. The company of woman robbed them of their spirituality because it destroyed their freedom.\n(\nTo Vijay\n)\n“You yourself perceive how far you have gone down by being a servant of others. Again, one finds that people with many university degrees, scholars with their vast English education, accept service under their English masters and are daily trampled under their boots. The one cause of all this is woman. They have married and set up a ‘gay fair’ with their wives and children. Now they cannot go back, much as they would like to. Hence all these insults and humiliations, all this suffering from slavery.\n“Once a man realises God through intense dispassion, he is no longer attached to woman. Even if he must lead the life of a householder, he is free from fear of and attachment to woman. Suppose there are two magnets, one big and the other small. Which one will attract the iron? The big one, of course. Cod is the big magnet. Compared to Him, woman is a small one. What can ‘woman’ do?”\nA DEVOTEE:\n“Sir, shall we hate women then?”\nMASTER:\n“He who has realised God does not look upon a woman with the eye of lust; so he is not afraid of her. He perceives clearly that women are but so many aspects of the Divine Mother. He worships them all as the Mother Herself.\n(\nTo Vijay\n) “Come here now and then. I like to see you very much.” (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)",

    "commentary": "Arjuna asked the Lord four questions about the\nSthitaprajna\n– (1) What are his qualities? (2) What does he speak? (3) How does he move? (4) How does he act?\nFrom the 55th verse till the end of the discourse, all the qualities mentioned constitute the general character of the sage of steady wisdom.\nIn this verse again the Lord speaks of the man who attains peace. Four important conditions are to be fulfilled before the man could experience the supreme peace of the Self.\nAll desires should be given up completely.\nThere should not be any taste or relish for them.\nThe feeling of me and mine should be given up.\nThe ego-centre attitude should be dropped.\nThe Lord repeats at the end what He was affirmed at the beginning of his estimate of the sthitaprajna. The word all (sarvam) is repeated emphatically many times, to show that all desires should be given up without any exception. Even if there is a single left in the mind, it grows and grows and binds man in samsara.\nIt is not enough to give up desires and sense pleasures externally. The seeker should not think of them even, nor entertain any longing for them.\nThe ego-centric attitude which is the root cause of bondage should be eliminated by knowledge of the real Self. It is the ego that attaches itself to the body and forges all the bonds of friends, relations, enemies, and so on. It is because of the ego-centric attitude that Arjuna was overpowered by delusion and sorrow at the thought of killing his people svajanam in battle. When the man does not identify himself with the body, all other attachments arising from the body are removed completely. When the body is not his, how can he have any attachment for things outside the body? Knowledge of the real Self clears away all doubts and perplexities, and then peace is attained.\nWe note once again that the general term anybody (yah) is used here, implying that wisdom is not the monopoly of persons belonging to any particular caste or creed. Whoever follows the Lord and the way shown by him will attain peace.",

    "translation": "Having obtained this Brahmi state man is not deluded. Being established in this even at the end of life man attains oneness with Brahman (Moksha).",
    "commentary": "The final goal of Vedanta is set forth here. All the practices – restraint of the senses, mind control, abandoning all ego-centric thoughts and feelings, having no consciousness of me and mine lead to the ultimate union of the individual being with the Supreme Self. The individual who thought of himself, as a separate entity now realises that he is no other than the Self, which is the Reality in himself and in all beings. This is the Brahmi-state. By constant meditation on the Self, the individual being becomes that, even as the worm becomes the bee by contemplating on it deeply and continuously. When the Brahmi-state is reached, all delusions cease, all doubts are cleared. The absolute Truth is realised.\nThe Lord declares that the sage who has attained this state, will not be subject to delusion at any time thereafter.\nEven at the end of life:\nIt does not mean that man attains the Brahmi-state in the last moments of his life. It means that he retains the supreme state even at the end of life. Such a man attains Moksha, the highest state of freedom and bliss. It is not possible to reach that state in the last moments of life if one had not struggled for it through a whole lifetime by performing sadhana. Even in old age, one should retain the memory of the supreme realisation. What is acquired by long practice should be kept fresh in the mind, even in the last moments of one’s life. The body and the mind are weak in old age. So the practice (sadhana) should begin when one is young and strong. The bad tendencies (samskaras) should be gradually eliminated. The mind should be purified and turned towards the Self, and constant meditation on the Self will lead to samadhi, and in samadhi, man realises his oneness with Brahman.\nThe Lord declares that He should be remembered at all times, not simply at the time of death. Moreover, what one thinks of and practices during a whole lifetime would be in the mind at the last moments. So continuous practice is necessary. No one can say when the end may come. So uninterrupted sadhana should go on from day to day, even from childhood. Then it does not matter when the end comes. He will be ready to face it because he knows the Truth.\nSo, instead of wasting time in foolish pursuits and vain endeavors, let the seeker start the sadhana at once and realise the Truth.",
