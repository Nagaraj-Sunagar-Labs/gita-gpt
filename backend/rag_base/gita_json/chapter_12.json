    "translation": "Arjuna said:\nThus, those who worship You, ever steadfast, and also those who meditate on the unmanifest Imperishable Brahman of the two types of seekers, who are superior knowers of yoga?",
    "commentary": "evam:\n(‘thus’): This word refers to the last verse\n(matkarmakrit etc.)\nin the previous Discourse.\nArjuna’s question is simple and clear. Who are superior – those who worship the Divine form, as the Cosmic Manifestation, or the four-armed Vishnu, or the cowherd boy of Brindavan\n(sagunopasaka)\n– or those who meditate on the formless, attributeless Brahman\n(nirgunopasaka)?\nIn the 2nd Discourse the Lord has declared the deathless and birthless reality of Atma, and in the 8th Discourse, he has explained the Nirguna aspect as Imperishable Brahman. It is quite natural for Arjuna to question the Lord about the superior excellence of either of the two. Arjuna’s question is the question of all seekers in the world – which is the better method of worship – Saguna or Nirguna?\nBhagavad Gita 12.1 to 12.2 by Swami Chetanananda\nThe next Sunday we left for Dakshineswar early in the morning. During that day’s visit I said to Sri Ramakrishna:\n“Some people say that God is formless; others say He has form; and still others call Him Krishna, Shiva, or Kali. Could you tell us what the real nature of God is?”\nSri Ramakrishna smiled and said: “He is sometimes with form; He is sometimes formless; and again He is beyond both. He is all-pervading. It is difficult to ascertain His real nature. Just as there is nothing to compare gold with except gold, so there is nothing equal to God. He is the cause of the gross objects as well as of the subtle mind and intellect. For example: The same substance in its solid form is ice; in its liquid form is water; and in its gaseous form is vapour. God manifests Himself according to the mental attitude of the spiritual aspirant. A jnani experiences God as all-pervading, formless space, and a devotee perceives God with a particular form. So if you sincerely want to know the real nature of God, meditate on Him in solitude. Have patience. Surrender yourself to Him and pray. When the right time comes you will see Him.”\nI then said, “We enjoy peace when we feel the presence of God in our hearts; otherwise mere intellectual understanding of God and atheism are the same.”\nSri Ramakrishna then replied: “In the beginning one should move forward on the spiritual path holding to an initial faith [i.e., faith in the words of the scriptures and the guru]. One then attains direct perception. There are two kinds of faith — initial faith and real faith [i.e., faith that comes from direct experience]. Be steadfast in the first one and then you will see God.”\n— Manomohan Mitra (Source: Ramakrishna as We Saw Him)\nBhagavad Gita: Chapter 12 🔻 (20 Verses)\n01\n02\n03\n04\n05\n06\n07\n08\n09\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20",

    "translation": "The Blessed Lord said: With mind established in Me, ever steadfast in their devotion, endowed with the highest faith, those who worship Me, they are in my opinion, the best of yogis.",
    "commentary": "The Lord answers Arjuna’s question about the superiority of the Saguna and Nirguna worshippers. The Lord declares that who-so-ever worships Him with supreme faith and single-minded concentration, he is the best of yogis. Three aspects of spiritual practice are mentioned here.\nEstablishing the mind in the Lord,\never thinking of Him,\nhaving firm faith in God.\nWhoever possesses these three qualities is the best of yogis. Whether he is a Saguna or Nirguna worshipper or whether he is a sannyasi or house-holder-these distinctions have no significance at all. The Lord’s amazing insight into spiritual Truth is revealed here.\nDevotion, faith, and concentrated effort-these are emphasised as the final determining factors in spiritual life and not the path or method of worship.\nSri Ramakrishna Says —\n“Dive deep; one does not get the precious gems by merely floating on the surface. God is without form, no doubt; but He also has form. By meditating on God with form one speedily acquires devotion; then one can meditate on the formless God. It is like throwing a letter away, after learning its contents, and then setting out to follow its instructions.” (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\n—–\nThe Master said to the kathak: “The gopis had ecstatic love, unswerving and single-minded devotion to one ideal. Do you know the meaning of devotion that is not loyal to one ideal? It is devotion tinged with intellectual knowledge. It makes one feel: ‘Krishna has become all these. He alone is the Supreme Brahman. He is Rama, Siva, and Sakti.’ But this element of knowledge is not present in ecstatic love of God. Once Hanuman came to Dwaraka and wanted to see Sita and Rama. Krishna said to Rukmini, His queen, ‘You had better assume the form of Sita; otherwise there will be no escape from the hands of Hanuman.'(Because Rama and Sita were Hanuman’s Chosen Ideals.) “Once the Pandava brothers performed the Rajasuya sacrifice. All the kings placed Yudhisthira on the royal throne and bowed low before him in homage. But Bibhishana, the King of Ceylon, said, ‘I bow down to Narayana and to none else.’ At these words the Lord Krishna bowed down to Yudhisthira. Only then did Bibhishana prostrate himself, crown and all, before him.\n“Do you know what devotion to one ideal is like? It is like the attitude of a daughter-in-law in the family. She serves all the members of the family — her brothers-in-law, father-in-law, husband, and so forth —, bringing them water to wash their feet, fetching their towels, arranging their seats, and the like; but with her husband she has a special relationship.\n“There are two elements in this ecstatic love: ‘I-ness’ and ‘my-ness’. Yasoda used to think: ‘Who would look after Gopala if I did not? He will fall ill if I do not serve Him.’ She did not look on Krishna as God. The other element is ‘my-ness’. It means to look on God as one’s own —’\nmy\nGopala’. Uddhava said to Yasoda: ‘Mother, your Krishna is God Himself. He is the Lord of the Universe and not a common human being.’ ‘Oh!’ exclaimed Yasoda. ‘I am not asking you about your Lord of the Universe. I want to know how\nmy\nGopala fares. Not the Lord of the Universe, but\nmy\nGopala.’\n“How faithful to Krishna the gopis were! After many entreaties to the door-keeper, the gopis entered the royal court in Mathura, where Krishna was seated as king. The door-keeper took them to Him; but at the sight of King Krishna wearing the royal turban, the gopis bent down their heads and said among themselves: ‘Who is this man with a turban on his head? Should we violate our chaste love for Krishna by talking to him? Where is our beloved Krishna with the yellow robe and the bewitching crest with the peacock feather?’\n“Did you observe the single-minded love of the gopis for Krishna? The ideal of Vrindavan is unique. I am told that the people of Dwaraka worship Krishna, the companion of Arjuna, but reject Radha.”\nA DEVOTEE: “Which is the better, ecstatic love or love mixed with knowledge?”\n10.21 Parable of the three friends\nMASTER:\n“\nIt is not possible to develop ecstatic love of God unless you love Him very deeply and regard Him as your very own.\n“Listen to a story. Once three friends were going through a forest, when a tiger suddenly appeared before them. ‘Brothers,’ one of them exclaimed, ‘we are lost!’ ‘Why should you say that?’ said the second friend. ‘Why should we be lost? Come, let us pray to God.’ The third friend said: ‘No. Why should we trouble God about it? Come, let us climb this tree.’\n“The friend who said, ‘We are lost!’ did not know that there is a God who is our Protector. The friend who asked the others to pray to God was a jnani. He was aware that God is the Creator, Preserver, and Destroyer of the world. The third friend, who didn’t want to trouble God with prayers and suggested climbing the tree, had ecstatic love of God. It is the very nature of such love that it makes a man think himself stronger than his Beloved. He is always alert lest his Beloved should suffer. The one desire of his life is to keep his Beloved from even being pricked in the foot by a thorn.” (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\nBhagavad Gita: Chapter 12 🔻 (20 Verses)\n01\n02\n03\n04\n05\n06\n07\n08\n09\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20",

Whatever may be the method of worship, if it is practised with faith and devotion, man reaches Paramatma. These two verses deal with persons who seek Nirguna Para Brahmam. This first verse states the attributes of the Imperishable Brahman and the second the qualities necessary for the aspirant for such realisation. Even though the seeker carries on his meditation on the formless Brahman, yet, if he does not possess purity of mind, self-restraint, equanimity, and love for all beings, his effort does not yield the desired results. Without these qualities of good character, realisation of Brahman is impossible. His worship will be like depositing good and relishing eatables in an impure vessel. All of them become corrupt and contaminated by the impurities of the vessel. Both the paths of realisation require the above qualities of character. Therefore the Lord mentions the three indispensable qualities of the aspirant in this context.\nComplete self-restraint,\nEqual-mindedness,\nUniversal love.\nThe seekers should cultivate these three qualities well while carrying on their method of worship. Here the word\n‘Samniyamya’\nis used to emphasise complete control of all the senses; the word\n‘Sarvatra’\nemphasises equanimity at all times and under all circumstances, and\n‘Sarvabhutahiteratah’\nemphasises love for all beings without any distinction whatsoever.

    "translation": "Greater is the difficulty for those whose mind is set on the realisation of the unmanifest (Nirguna Brahman), because the unmanifested is reached with difficulty by embodied beings.",
    "commentary": "It is here declared that for those who are body-minded, the worship of Nirguna Brahman is very difficult. For others it is easy. That is, for the aspirant who is more self-controlled, who has acquired facility in desireless action, the contemplation of Brahman is quite suitable and comfortable. So it should be clearly understood that the difficulty here is only for those who have not acquired purity by worshipping Isvara (God). It should also be remembered that in the previous two verses, the Lord has declared that the goal of both paths is the same, and both require certain qualities without which no spiritual growth is possible.\nTherefore let the seekers be not in a hurry to reach the unmanifest even at the start. Let them try to get over the body-attached egoism by the worship of Isvara, and obtain complete mastery of their senses through the desireless performance of all good actions. Then self-realisation becomes possible and man attains union with Brahman easily. Most people complain that their ‘sadhana’ is not bearing fruit. It is because their minds are not purified. Of what use is it to sow the seeds before preparing the ground? Will any building stand without a proper foundation? So, the mind does not come to rest in Brahman when it is impure by past ‘samskaras’. The aspirant should understand the position correctly so that he might not feel frustrated by failing to get the proper results immediately.\nIn truth, worship and meditation are realms of bliss and blessedness. One is entering the ocean of Sachidananda! Why the pain and difficulty? It is intended to remove suffering and not to cause it. But people find it difficult and painful because they do not know the path clearly and distinctly. So for some time in the beginning let the seekers carry on the worship of Isvara\n(Saguna)\nand then enter the path of meditation on the imperishable Brahman\n(Nirguna)\n.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda\nSwami Vivekananda Says —\nHere [comes] the philosopher to show us the way out, to teach us what we really are. You may reason it out and understand it intellectually, but there is a long way between intellectual understanding and the practical realization of it. Between the plan of the building and the building itself there is quite a long distance. Therefore there must be various methods [to reach the goal of religion]. In the last course, we have been studying the method of philosophy, trying to bring everything under control, once more asserting the freedom of the soul. “It is very difficult. This way is not for [every]body. The embodied mind tries it with great trouble.”\n[Source]\nBhakti, then, can be directed towards Brahman, only in His personal aspect. “The way is more difficult for those whose mind is attached to the Absolute!” Bhakti has to float on smoothly with the current of our nature.\n[Source]\nSri Ramakrishna Says —\nMASTER:\n“God has form and, again. He is formless. Once upon a time a sannyasi entered the temple of Jagannath. As he looked at the holy image he debated within himself whether God had a form or was formless. He passed his staff from left to right to feel whether it touched the image. The staff touched nothing. He understood that there was no image before him; he concluded that God was formless. Next he passed the staff from right to left. It touched the image. The sannyasi understood that God had form Thus he realised that God has form and, again, is formless.\n“But it is extremely difficult to understand this. Naturally the doubt arises in the mind: if God is formless, how then can He have form? Further, if He has a form, why does He have so many forms?” (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\n—–\nSri Ramakrishna went to the Panchavati on his way back to his room. M. accompanied him. It was then about ten o’clock.\nMahendranath Gupta:\n“Sir, is there no spiritual discipline leading to realization of the Impersonal God?”\nSri Ramakrishna\n: “Yes, there is.\nBut the path is extremely difficult.\nAfter intense austerities the rishis of olden times realized God as their innermost consciousness and experienced the real nature of Brahman. But how hard they had to work! They went out of their dwellings in the early morning and all day practised austerities and meditation. Returning home at nightfall, they took a light supper of fruit and roots.\n“But an aspirant cannot succeed in this form of spiritual discipline if his mind is stained with worldliness even in the slightest degree. The mind must withdraw totally from all objects of form, taste, smell, touch, and sound. Only thus does it become pure. The Pure Mind is the same as the Pure Atman. But such a mind must be altogether free from ‘woman and gold’. When it becomes pure, one has another experience. One realizes: ‘God alone is the Doer, and I am His instrument.’ One does not feel oneself to be absolutely necessary to others either in their misery or in their happiness.\n“Once a wicked man beat into unconsciousness a monk who lived in a monastery. On regaining consciousness he was asked by his friends, ‘Who is feeding you milk?’ The monk said, ‘He who beat me is now feeding me.'”\nM:\n“Yes, sir. I know that story.”\nMASTER:\n“\nIt is not enough to know it. One must assimilate its meaning.\nIt is the thought of worldly objects that prevents the mind from going into samadhi. One becomes established in samadhi when one is completely rid of worldliness. ……\nM:\n“Isn’t it possible to develop both jnana and bhakti by the practice of spiritual discipline?”\nMASTER:\n“Through the path of bhakti a man may attain them both. If it is necessary, God gives him the Knowledge of Brahman. But a highly qualified aspirant may develop both jnana and bhakti at the same time. ………. (Source:\nThe Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\n—–\n“In order to meditate on God, one should try at first to think of Him as free from upadhis, limitations. God is beyond upadhis. He is beyond speech and mind. But it is very difficult to achieve perfection in this form of meditation.\n“But it is easy to meditate on an Incarnation — God born as man. Yes, God in man. The body is a mere covering. It is like a lantern with a light burning inside, or like a glass case in which one sees precious things.” (Source:\nThe Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\n—–\nA NEIGHBOUR:\n“Revered sir, what are the doctrines of Vedanta?”\nMASTER:\n‘The Vedantist says, ‘I am He.’ Brahman is real and the world illusory. Even the ‘I’ is illusory. Only the Supreme Brahman exists.\n“But the ‘I’ cannot be got rid of. Therefore it is good to have the feeling, ‘I’ am the servant of God, His son, His devotee.’\n“For the Kaliyuga the path of bhakti is especially good. One can realise God through bhakti too. As long as one is conscious of the body, one is also conscious of objects. Form, taste, smell, sound, and touch — these are the objects. It is extremely difficult to get rid of the consciousness of objects. And one cannot realise ‘I am He’ as long as one is aware of objects.\n“The sannyasi is very little conscious of worldly objects. But the house-holder is always engrossed in them. Therefore it is good for him to feel, ‘I am the servant of God.’” (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\n—–\nIn order to learn archery one should first aim at a banana tree, then at a reed, then at a wick, and last at a flying bird. At the beginning one should concentrate on God with form. (Source:\nThe Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\n—–\nForm to Formless\nOne of these visitors, Gadashankar, was a follower of Keshab Chandra Sen. The Master talked with him on the eastern veranda while I (Swami Akhandananda) was there.\n“Do you practise the brahminical rites daily?” the Master asked him.\n“I do not like all these rituals,” he said.\n“You see,” the Master went on, “do not give up anything by force. If the blossoms of gourds and pumpkins are plucked off, their fruits rot, but when the fruits are ripe the flowers fall off naturally. Do you believe in a God with form or in a formless God?”\n“In the formless aspect,” was the reply.\n“But how can you grasp the formless aspect all at once?” the Master asked. “When the archers are learning to shoot, they first aim at the plantain tree, then at a thin tree, then at a fruit, then at the leaves, and finally at a flying bird. First meditate on the aspect with form. This will enable you to see the formless later.”\n(Source: God Lived with Them)\n‘The path of Brahman is very difficult. Pray to the Master(\nSri Ramakrishna\n) and he will give you the knowledge of Brahman in proper time.’\n— Sri Sarada Devi (Source:\nTeachings of Sri Sarada Devi by Swami Vireswarananda\n)\nKnowledge of Brahman and such things is not for ordinary people. For them the Lord’s words : “To those whose minds are set on Me, verily I become ere long, O son of Prithâ, the saviour out of the ocean of the mortal Samsâra (world)”; for “the goal of the Unmanifested is very hard for the embodied to reach.” The knowledge of Brahman is difficult for him who has not got over the consciousness of mind and body. But then, because the knowledge of Brahman is beyond the reach of such, it is not that they should become hopeless. In this connection an incident in the life of Shri Ramakrishna flashes before my mind. One day I had been to Dakshineswar. There were many others also. One of them was a great Pundit. Shri Ramakrishna asked him to explain Vedânta. For more than an hour he explained Vedanta to the great satisfaction of Shri Ramakrishna and everybody else. But then, Shri Ramakrishna said after this, “Well, all these things, however, do not appeal to me. Your philosophising—knowledge, knower, and known, etc.—all this is good no doubt. But what I like is, ‘I and my Mother alone exist and there is nothing else’.” These few words he expressed with such great feeling that everyone present felt it for the time being. All the conclusions of Vedanta seemed to pale before this idea. The Master’s idea seemed to be so easy to comprehend.\nThe main thing is, you have to keep your mind fixed on God, whatever be the means. If that can be done, then our lives are blessed and won’t be spent uselessly. Eating, drinking, etc. we shall have so long as the body lasts. But Râmprasâd, the devotee of Kâli, says, “O my mind, worship Kâli, repeat day and night the Mantra given by your Guru. In lying down think you are prostrating before the Mother, make sleep your meditation on the Mother, while eating think you are offering to Mother Shyâmâ; all sounds that enter your ears are but Mantras of the Mother, for She, Kâli, is in all letters; going round the town, think you are circumambulating the Mother. Râmprasâd declares that Mother is in everything.” We have to follow the teachings of such great souls as these, and we are sure to have devotion for the Lord’s feet. Is what Râmprasâd says different from the knowledge of Brahman—seeing God in everything, everywhere, in every action, and in every being ? To work for the Lord, to know Him as the one object of our love, to love Him and give up all other attachments and to have no ill-feeling towards anyone—this is the easiest method to attain Him. Love, Love, that is what is required : if we have it for Him, then everything will be added unto us. It is not that we do not know what is love. We are habituated to love wife, children, friends, wealth, etc. This we have to direct towards God, for He is the one Reality in this world which is ever changing. Everything else in this world becomes after some time stale and even bitter. Love for Him alone is ever on the increase and ever new. With respect to other objects one gets disgusted after some time. That is why Prahlâda, the great devotee, says, “That deathless love which the ignorant have for the fleeting objects of the senses—as I keep meditating on Thee—may not that sort of intense love for Thee, slip away from my heart.” If one gets such love for Him there is no more delay for God-realisation—He even comes out of the pillar to manifest Himself to His devotee. Everything is a question of love. The more one loves Him, the more He manifests Himself in one’s heart. He is the friend of the sincere and pure. He is ever in our hearts, but we fail to see Him because our eyes are directed to other objects ; but for this there would have been no delay in realising Him. He is ever with us, we need not go to any place of pilgrimage in search of Him. If we but in all sincerity search Him for a moment, He comes to us. But who wants Him ? Ours is mere talk, we do not want Him from our hearts. Such is the power of Maya that we fail to see the Truth. So the Lord, out of His grace, has shown us the way out also. “Those who are absolutely resigned to Me, easily cross over this Maya of Mine.” “Surrender to Me”—there is no other way out. May the Lord out of His infinite grace hold our minds on to His feet—let this be our one prayer.\n— Swami Turiyananda (Source: Religion and it’s Practice by Disciples of Sri Ramakrishna)\nSwami Shivananda: “If you meditate on God with form, He Himself will reveal to you His real nature. There is something beyond form. This (what we see) is gross. Beyond this is the subtle, and then comes the causal, and so on. It is very difficult to meditate on the formless. The Vedas prescribe Akasha (primal matter or space) as a symbol of the formless God. Other symbols like the ocean etc. may also be taken, but Akâsha is better. He is minuter than the minutest and greater than the greatest.’ He resides in the heart of man as consciousness. But then one has to start with some form. There is no question of inferiority or superiority in this-it is a question of temperament. Whatever appeals to one is the best for him.\nForm melts into the formless and again the formless takes a form.\nGod is both with form and with-out form, and again beyond both. It is not possible to know Him with this mind. He can be comprehended only by the pure mind. The Master used to say, ‘The pure mind and the Self are one.’ That mind in which there are no mentations or desires, cannot be called mind. Then there exists only an all-pervading consciousness, power, or Brahman-whatever you may call it. That again takes form according to the temperament of the devotee. All this is hard to comprehend. If one be not constantly engaged in selfless work, study of scriptures, worship, Japa, and meditation, it is not possible to comprehend the truth of Vedanta. If there is His grace, these things come of themselves and one feels inclined to practise all these things. Without His grace one becomes averse to His name, finds no taste for it, and all talk about God becomes unbearable. The Lord’s grace is already on him in whose mind thoughts about God arise spontaneously. There is nothing like higher or lower as between God without form and with form. Everything is He. It is the same Ganga that you have at Kalighat, Dakshineswar, Varanasi, Allahabad, and Hardwar.” (Source: Spiritual Talks by the First Disciples of Sri Ramakrishna)\nBhagavad Gita: Chapter 12 🔻 (20 Verses)\n01\n02\n03\n04\n05\n06\n07\n08\n09\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20",

    "translation": "Fix the mind firmly in Me only; place the intellect in Me, thereafter you shall live in Me only; there is no doubt about this.",
    "commentary": "The Lord is now teaching various practices to reach Him, one after another. The Lord is clear and simple in the teaching, like an able teacher when he is instructing a young boy. The first lesson is fixing the mind firmly in Him. It is not enough to fix the mind only, the intellect also should be placed in Him. Why? The intellect is the deciding power, and without its direction, the mind wavers and wanders away from the goal. The mind thinks and reason decides. It is reason (‘buddhi’) which takes the final decision that the Lord alone is real and all else is like water in a mirage. By the very power of this decision, the mind becomes one-pointed and is then established in God. If the mind wavers, it is because the intellect has not decided right. So the Lord here says that the intellect should be placed in Him. Then meditation becomes deep and firm. Man then lives in God. Like salt dissolving in water, the mind becomes that which it contemplates. Thinking of the Lord, by giving up all the evil qualities arising from ignorance and past samskaras is Moksha. This is what is meant by living in God. The Lord adds-there is no doubt about this. “Follow this practice, and you shall live in Me”, declares the Lord to all mankind and assuredly confirms his declaration. The devotee’s duty is stated here, and his future is taken over by the Lord.\nna samsayah:\nThere is no doubt about it. What should be the faith of the devotee, when the Lord gives such an assurance!\nmayi eva:\n“In Me only” – the mind should not move away from the Lord towards any other object.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda\nSwami Vivekananda Says —\nShri Krishna was God, incarnated to save mankind. Gopi-Lila (his disport with cowherd maids) is the acme of the religion of love in which individuality vanishes and there is communion. It is in this Lila that Shri Krishna shows what he preaches in the Gita: “Give up every other tie for me.”\n[Source]\nSri Ramakrishna Says —\nMASTER (\nto Ishan\n):\n“Tell me if you have any more doubts.”\nISHAN:\n“You said everything when you spoke of faith.”\nMASTER:\n“God can be realised by true faith alone. And the realisation is hastened if you believe everything about God. The cow that picks and chooses its food gives milk only in dribblets, but if she eats all kinds of plants, then her milk flows in torrents.\n“Once I heard a story. A man heard the command of God that he should see his Ideal Deity in a ram. He at once believed it. It is God who exists in all beings.\n“A guru said to his disciple, ‘It is Rama alone who resides in all bodies.’ The disciple was a man of great faith. One day a dog snatched a piece of bread from him and started to run away. He ran after the dog, with a jar of butter in his hand, and cried again and again: ‘O Rama, stand still a minute. That bread hasn’t been buttered.’\n“What tremendous faith Krishnakishore had! He used to say, ‘By chanting “Om Krishna, Om Rama”, one gets the result of a million sandhyas.’ Once he said to me secretly, ‘I don’t like the sandhya and other devotions any more; but don’t tell anyone.’\n“Sometimes I too feel that way. The Mother reveals to me that She Herself has become everything. One day I was coming from the pine-grove toward the Panchavati. A dog followed me. I stood still for a while near the Panchavati. The thought came to my mind that the Mother might say something to me through that dog.\n“You were absolutely right when you said that through faith alone one achieves all.” (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)",

The Lord exhorts. Arjuna to attain that state by the yoga of constant practice. There is no other way. Everyone should strive for this state by withdrawing the mind from external objects and fixing it in the Self. If, in the beginning, this is not possible, by slow and steady practice the mind should be trained to enter the inner sphere of Atma. As Moksha is nothing else but merging the mind in Atma, all seekers should achieve it sooner or later. In the Sixth Discourse, the Lord has already pointed out the truth.",

They should engage themselves in doing good actions, charitable deeds of helpfulness, and beneficence to all beings.

Japa, prayer, ‘namasamkirtan’, worship, vows of fasting and silence, all these come under good actions for the sake of God. This is the idea of\n“matkarmaparamobhava”\n. By such actions, the mind is purified, and by the purity of mind, liberation is attained. Thus Nishkama Karma leads to perfection. This is recommended to those who are not able to still the mind in Dhyana. Only, those actions should be done in a spirit of self-surrender to God. They should be done to win God’s grace and not for obtaining selfish rewards. This idea should be firmly held in the mind while performing all good work in the world.",

That is, all work should be done in a spirit of self-surrender to God. Bad actions are not included here, because they are already prohibited by the Sastras. No one should do sinful acts. Worship of God, singing His name and glory, charity, works of social welfare, all these are good actions and they should be surrendered to God.\n(Isvararpanam, Ramarpanam, or Krishnarpanam)\n. As several paths are suggested, each man may take up any practice suitable to his physical and mental predisposition. This last path is within the reach of all persons. While walking, let it be thought of as\npradakshinam\nof God. While talking let it be thought of as singing His glory. This may be extended to all actions. By this, the Lord is constantly kept in view, and the mind, without any strain comes to entertain Godly ideas in a natural way. The Lord has already said\n“mamanusmara yudhya ca”\n– “Remember Me and fight.” So, this path is the easiest and the best-fitted for all sincere seekers on the spiritual path. All sin is destroyed, the mind becomes pure, and liberation is attained ultimately.\nyatatmavan:\nThe seeker should be self-controlled. Without it, the constant memory of God and self-surrender to Him are not possible.

    "commentary": "Here ‘abhyasa’ means practice without discrimination; ‘jnana’ means knowledge got through study of books, ‘Dhyana’ means thinking over the object at the time of meditation.\nJnanat dhyanam visishyate:\nOf course, direct experience through\n‘Dhyana’\nis far higher than mere knowledge got through the study of the scriptures.\n‘Dhyana’\nmeans the realisation of knowledge by constant meditation. This is indeed far higher than mere knowledge derived from the study of books.\nDhyanat karmaphalatyagah:\nRenunciation of action and their fruits is higher than ‘Dhyana’.\nFor the unripened Dhyana – yogi, the mind may be still and pure only at the time of mediation. But when he comes into practical life, there is always the danger of its being contaminated by worldly objects. But for the man who has surrendered all actions to God, the mind is always pure.\nThe ‘Tyagi’ enjoys purity everywhere and at all times. Therefore it is said here that ‘tyaga’ is higher than ‘Dhyana’. From this, we understand the superior excellence of ‘Nishkama Karma’. Most people are engaged in work. Very few can renounce work completely. So for the majority of mankind, this path is most suitable and leads them to a higher realisation than ‘jnana’ and ‘dhyana’. Moreover, purity of mind is essential for all yogas. And such purity is attainable by Nishkama Karma. If this is practised for long, the foundation of spiritual life would be firm and steady. The higher realisation can be had only after this purity is perfected in the mind and heart.\nTyagat santiranantaram:\nPeace is the immediate reward of self-surrender to God. Renunciation of the ego, renunciation of the objective world, renunciation of sin and evil – this is immediately followed by peace. The impurities of the mind being cleansed, peace flows into it like a flood\n(tesham santih saswati netaresham)\n. Atma shines forth in the pure heart. Everyone in the sorrowful world is seeking for peace. How to get it?\n“tyagat santih”\n– from renunciation, peace is obtained. Therefore one should give up all sensual pleasures, fruits of actions, egoism and the binding sense of doership. Then he shall experience the highest peace. Such is the path shown by the Lord to all mankind.\nSri Ramakrishna Says —\nMASTER:\n“You see, there is no need to read too much of the scriptures. If you read too much you will be inclined to reason and argue. Nangta used to teach me thus: What you get by repeating the word ‘Gita’ ten times is the essence of the book. In other words, if you repeat ‘Gita’ ten times it is reversed into ‘tagi’, which indicates renunciation.\n“Yes, the way to realise God is through discrimination, renunciation, and yearning for Him. What kind of yearning? One should yearn for God as the cow, with yearning heart, runs after its calf.”\nPUNDIT:\n“The same thing is said in the Vedas: ‘O God, we call on Thee as the cow lows for the calf.'”\nMASTER:\n“Add your tears to your yearning. And if you can renounce everything through discrimination and dispassion, then you will be able to see God. That yearning brings about God-intoxication, whether you follow the path of knowledge or the path of devotion. The sage Durvasa was mad with the Knowledge of God.\n“There is a great deal of difference between the knowledge of a house-holder and that of an all-renouncing sannyasi. The householder’s knowledge is like the light of a lamp, which illumines only the inside of a room. He cannot see anything, with the help of such knowledge, except his own body and his immediate family. But the knowledge of the all-renouncing monk is like the light of the sun. Through that light he can see both inside and outside the room. Chaitanyadeva’s knowledge had the brilliance of the sun — the sun of Knowledge. Further, he radiated the soothing light of the moon of Devotion. He was endowed with both — the Knowledge of Brahman and ecstatic love of God. (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\nIn March 1905\nSwami Ramakrishnananda\nwent to celebrate the Ramakrishna festival in Burma … On the festival day the swami walked four miles to pick\nnageswar champa\nflowers, which were the Master’s favourite. Sharat Chandra Chattopadhyay, the celebrated Bengali novelist (then an unknown young man) accompanied Ramakrishnananda on this walk. Sharat had read Darwin, Tyndall, Mill, and other Western thinkers and considered himself an atheist. On the way, Sharat asked: “Why do you worship so much?”\nSwami Ramakrishnananda:\n“Because I derive immense joy from it.”",

Of course, joy is a good quality, but here it refers to the unbalanced fits of elations that overtake the common man when good things come to him. Joy and sorrow are pairs of opposites (dvandas) which stand in the way of realisation. Unless the mind is freed from these pairs, firmness in self-realisation is impossible.\nsubbhasubhaparityagi:\nThis may give rise to doubt for the reader. The way of the world is to give up ‘asubha’ and hold on to ‘subha’. Here it is stated that both should be renounced. We must understand these statements continuously by studying the context of each of these thoughts. Here the ultimate goal of ‘Bhakti’ is being declared. The final end of Bhakti and Jnana are the same. The perfect devotee and the perfect ‘Jnani’, both have their life and being in the Divine, the Atma. This state is that of the ‘Jivanmukta’ who has transcended all the modifications of the mind. In that state the pairs of opposites like heat and cold, pleasure and pain, joy and sorrow, good and bad, do not exist. Only the Divine, the Atma exits. So the perfect devotee is free from both good and bad. The seekers should take to ‘subha’ first and eliminate ‘asubha’, and then both should be given up. This is the thought-free (‘nirvikalpa’) state. ‘Subha’ and ‘asubha’ drop away in the ultimate stage when only the Divine appears everywhere for the perfected devotee. This is the idea of subhasubhaparityagi, and not giving up good and auspicious actions.\nCommentary by Swami Chetanananda\nBhagavad Gita: Chapter 12 🔻 (20 Verses)\n01\n02\n03\n04\n05\n06\n07\n08\n09\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20",

Therefore, along with natural flowers, it is necessary to worship the Lord with flowers of virtue and spiritual conduct. May all the seekers learn His higher form of worship and obtain God’s grace.\nOf all worldly things, the greatest and the most precious possession of man is the Lord’s love, and such love cannot be attained except by the practice of the above-mentioned virtues.

He who does not depend on anything, who is pure and active, who does not care whether good comes or evil, and never becomes miserable, who has given up all efforts for himself; who is the same in praise or in blame, with a silent, thoughtful mind, blessed with what little comes in his way, homeless, for the whole world is his home, and who is steady in his ideas, such a one is My beloved bhakta.” Such alone become yogis.\n[Source]",
