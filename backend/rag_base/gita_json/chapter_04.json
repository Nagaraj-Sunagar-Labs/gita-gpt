    "translation": "O Arjuna! The royal sages know this (yoga) which was handed down in regular succession from generation to generation. But by long lapse of time, this Yoga was lost to the world.",
    "commentary": "Royal sages -Kings who knew Brahmavidya are called royal sages. They are Jnanis as well as rulers, who possessed royalty and wisdom together. In the earliest times, several Kings and emperors were endowed with Self-Knowledge. The term `Rishi’ is a title. Anyone can acquire it. Even an ordinary man becomes a `Rishi’ when he comes to possess Atma vidya. So the man who conquers the senses and mind, who is able to practise nishkama karma, and who has attained a glimpse of the Supreme Self is a Rishi.\nWe have to understand that in former ages, Kings were the real possessors of Brahma vidya. This proves that worldly life is not in any way a barrier to Atma vidya. Let us imagine the life of a King in former times. He was the supreme power of the state, and he was responsible for the administration of the whole kingdom. How many cares and anxieties he must have had in discharging his royal duties. And yet, it was the king who acquired and possessed the highest wisdom. The practical application of Vedanta to actual life was the contribution of these great monarchs to the world. Let us hear the words of Swami Vivekananda on this point. “\nIn various Upanishads, we find that this Vedanta philosophy is not the outcome of meditation in the forests only but that the very best parts of it were thought out by brains which were busiest in the everyday affairs of life. We cannot conceive any man busier than an absolute monarch, a man ruling over millions of people and yet, some of these rulers were deep thinkers.\n” Arjuna comes of a noble family of royal sages. So it would not be difficult for him to tread the path of the ancient kings who were adept both in worldly matters and spiritual knowledge.\nIt does not mean that others are not qualified for this Yoga. In fact, the Lord’s message is for people who are engaged in the different avocations of life, like teachers, politicians, administrators, agriculturists or shop-keepers, etc. Very often we hear people brushing aside anything of spiritual knowledge as an obstacle to their worldly activities, which they say are necessary for the maintenance of this life. This verse condemns such an apathetic attitude to the spiritual life because it is pointed out that monarchs have practised this Yoga with great advantage to their spiritual and practical life.\nWas lost:\nThis does not mean that Karma Yoga as a spiritual path was completely destroyed. Some incidents might have caused neglect of this Yoga for the time being. But it cannot be destroyed as it is imperishable – Avyayam. Just as the Lord is eternal, even so, the Dharma established by Him is eternal.\nBhagavad Gita 4.2 by Swami Sarvapriyananda\nBhagavad Gita: Chapter 4 🔻\n(42 Verses)\n01\n02\n03\n04\n05\n06\n07\n08\n09\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42",

    "translation": "This same ancient Yoga has now been taught by Me, for you are My devotee and friend. It is indeed the supreme secret.",
    "commentary": "The spiritual path of Karma Yoga is not a new invention. It is an ancient path. But owing to the change of times, it was covered up and neglected for some time. But it is imperishable. When spiritual Dharma suffers decline, the Lord incarnates Himself to re-establish it. Great spiritual men like Sankara and others come into the world to reclaim the declining Dharma and re-establish it in the world. This same ancient knowledge is now taught to Arjuna by Lord Krishna.\nWhy should the Lord choose Arjuna only to be the recipient of this knowledge? This is answered by this verse. Arjuna was a devotee and a friend of the Lord. Therefore this supreme secret was revealed to him. Whoever loves the Lord is His friend and devotee. On him, the Lord bestows supreme knowledge.\nSo one should acquire the faith and devotion of Arjuna, and to such a man the Lord Himself offers all the secrets of spiritual knowledge. The Lord has no attachment of friend or foe. Whoever loves Him receives His love and compassion. Arjuna’s faith in the Lord has won for him a place in the heart of Krishna, and hence the divine message was offered to him.\nBest secret:\nThe spiritual path of `nishkama karma’ is not only a secret but a royal path to knowledge. Such a precious secret cannot be thrown away carelessly on indifferent people who can neither understand it nor wish to practise it. The right man should be chosen to communicate the suet of perfection. Arjuna was the right man because he had devotion and love for the Lord.\nBhagavad Gita 4.3 by Swami Sarvapriyananda",

    "translation": "Arjuna said: Later was your birth, earlier the birth of Vivasvan (Sun); how then am I to understand that you taught it to him in the beginning?",
    "commentary": "In the Rajasuya Yaga, Arjuna has already come to know that Krishna is the eternal Lord of the Universe, though he is apparently the son of Devaki and Vasudeva. Still, it is quite possible that the supreme secret of the Lord’s incarnation might have appeared as a mystery to Arjuna, and he desired that the Lord Himself should unravel the mystery. Arjuna’s doubt is the doubt of all ordinary human beings, and so the Lord’s answer is intended to enlighten mankind about the mystery of His incarnation in the world.\nIndeed, Lord Krishna is not a material form composed of the five elements as is the body of a human being. He is the eternal all-pervading Supreme Being of the Universe. This very truth is declared by the Lord in his reply to Arjuna. This universe and all that is in it can be looked at from three planes of vision. As soon as one sees a material object, man or animal or plant or stone or anything else, he takes in the object through the visual sense organ – the form, the colour, shape and complexion and other aspects of its external appearance. When he rises to the mental plane, he considers the character, qualities and nature of the object which could be understood only by the mind. When he rises higher still, he finds that all this universe with all that exists in it is nothing but the soul, the Atma – the supreme Sacchidananda. This is the spiritual plane of vision. The former two are relative truths. The last is the absolute Truth. To distinguish this relative from the Absolute, and hold on to the Absolute is the aim of spiritual Sadhana.\nSwami Vivekananda Says —\n“This yoga I taught in ancient times [to Vivasvan; Vivasvan taught it to Manu]. … Thus it was that the knowledge descended from one thing to another. But in time this great yoga was destroyed. That is why I am telling it to you again today.” Then Arjuna asks, “Why do you speak thus? You are a man born only the other day, and [Vivasvan was born long before you]. What do you mean that you taught him?”\n[Source]\nBhagavad Gita 4.4 by Swami Sarvapriyananda\nBhagavad Gita: Chapter 4 🔻\n(42 Verses)\n01\n02\n03\n04\n05\n06\n07\n08\n09\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42",

    "translation": "The Lord said: O Arjuna! Many births of Mine have passed as well as yours. I know them all but you know them not.",
    "commentary": "Iswara, the Lord and Jiva, the personalised man are both of the same substance – the Supreme Brahman. Iswara is the Lord of Maya; and Jiva is subject to Maya. Iswara incarnates himself by controlling Maya, for the purpose of establishing Dharma in the world. But the Jiva is born again and again to work out his own karma, under the power and control of Maya. Since the Lord is the Lord of Maya, He knows all His incarnations from the beginning of creation, whereas the Jiva forgets them by the deluding power of Maya.\nOn account of Avidya, man’s knowledge is confined to the present life only. In truth, every man has passed through myriads of births. He had parents, wives and children, friends and enemies, wealth and prosperity, good and bad, during thousands of former births. But he has no knowledge of them now. If man fails to cut the bonds of karma by knowledge of Atma, he has still to pass through innumerable births. By virtue of the ‘good that he has done, he has now acquired the human birth, endowed with reason and discrimination, and not the birth of a worm or reptile, bird or beast. Having this great good fortune if still he indulges in sense pleasures and gets lost in the meshes of karma, he is indeed an unfortunate being.\nWhen the embryo in the mother’s womb attains the seventh month, he gets the vision of his past births for a brief time and then, he vows to the Lord that he would strive to dedicate his present birth to Self-realisation. But as soon as he comes out of the mother’s womb, he forgets all and is lost in the pleasures and pains of earthly existence. Such is the power of Maya.\nLet people not forget that they have had the same pleasures and pains during myriads of births, and when they realise this, they lose all taste and resort for worldly attachments and pleasures. Then comes true renunciation, and the march to their original state of perfection begins. So the Lord tells Arjuna that he (Arjuna) had several births in the past, though he is not able to recollect them on account of his mortal nature.\nBhagavad Gita 4.5 by Swami Sarvapriyananda\nOne day the Mother visited Sarnath. When she saw some foreigners observing with evident astonishment the Buddhist ruins there, she said,\n“These are the very people who built these things in their previous birth. Now they have come again, and are amazed at their own doings!”\n(Source: Gospel of The Holy Mother)\n—-\nWhen Holy Mother visited Rameshwaram temple, Tamil Nadu in 1910, she was directly taken to the\nsanctum sanctorum\nand was allowed to worship Lord Shiva in the form of uncovered\nShivalingam\n. The Mother offered 108 golden leaves shaped like the real leaves of the bel (vilva) tree. She stayed in that small town for three days and every morning and evening she would visit the temple and perform worship with flowers,\nchandan\n(sandal) and vilva leaves. The Holy Mother observed all customary traditions of the temple.\nIt is said that Brahmachari Krishnalal who was an attendant to Holy Mother heard Mother uttering in a mood unaware of the external world:\n‘It is just as I had left.’\nAfter a few weeks in Kolkata when once Kedar babu enquired of Mother about her visit to Rameshwaram, she uttered once again,\n‘He is just as I had left Him, my son!’\n—–\nThe party then went to Vrindaban. From there Sri Ramakrishna went to visit Mount Govardhan and the nearby Shyamkunda and Radhakunda by palanquin. On the way the Master wept bitterly, saying:\n“O Krishna! Everything here is as it was in the olden days. You alone are absent.”\nHriday followed him and warned the bearers to be careful with the Master. (Source: They Lived with God)\nOne day I (Swami Akhandananda) visited the Master and had prasad at the temple. A group of lay devotees came after his noon rest, and I spread a mat for them on the floor. One of them asked the Master, “Sir, is it good that these young boys come to you to embrace the monastic life, disregarding the householder’s life?” The Master replied:\n“Look, you only see their present life, and not their previous lives in which they passed through these other stages.\nFor instance, a man has four sons. One of them, having grown up, says: ‘I shall not put oil on my body or eat fish. I shall eat only self-cooked vegetarian food.’ The parents try to dissuade him from these habits and even threaten him, but the boy will not give up the path of renunciation. Yet the other three sons are set on enjoyment and swallow whatever they get. Look, it is because of the preponderance of sattva that this boy wants to renounce everything before he reaches manhood.” (Source: God Lived with Them)\nAs other Incarnations of God have had someone to witness or collect their teachings, perhaps M. was this same great soul born again for that purpose. Sri Ramakrishna recognized M.’s value at first sight, and the following comments he made about M. indicate that M. was not an ordinary person: “I recognized you on hearing you read the Chaitanya Bhagavat. You are my own. The same substance, like father and son. . . . Before you came here, you didn’t know who you were. Now you will know.” “Once [in a vision] I saw Gauranga and his devotees singing kirtan in the Panchavati. I think I saw Balaram there and you too.” “Yes,\nI know everything: what your Ideal is, who you are, your inside and outside, the events of your past lives, and your future.\n” “I can see from the signs of your eyes, brows, and face that you are a yogi. You look like a yogi who has just left his seat of meditation.” (Source: They Lived with God)\nOn 15 July 1885, Balaram asked the Master, “Sir, how was it possible for Purna to know all of a sudden that the world is illusory?” Sri Ramakrishna replied: “He has inherited that knowledge from his previous births. In his past lives he practised many disciplines. It is the body alone that is small or grows big, and not the Atman. Do you know what these youngsters are like? They are like certain plants that grow fruit first and then flowers. These devotees first of all have the vision of God; next they hear about His glories and attributes; and at last they are united with Him.” (Source: They Lived with God)\nIt was Sunday, about nine in the morning. Mahapurushji was seated on a couch in his room. Many devotees were assembled and interesting things were under discussion. Becoming inquisitive, a devotee asked, ‘Maharaj, how old are you?’",

    "commentary": "In the previous verse, the Lord said that He too had passed through several births. And now, in order to clear any misconception concerning the nature of this birth, the Lord explained the mystery and significance of his incarnation.\nThe common man takes birth as an effect of his own Karma. But the Lord has no such Karma to work out, and nothing has power over him. He is himself the Supreme Lord and master of the whole universe and rules over it by His mysterious power of Maya. Why then should he take birth? It is for the purpose of doing good to the world. He takes a form by His own will, using the power of Maya as His instrument. Three attributes of the Lord are mentioned here. He has no birth (Ajah). He is eternal (Avyayatma). He is the Supreme Lord of all beings (Bhutanam isvarah). From this, we understand that Lord Krishna is apparently the son of Devaki and Vasudeva, but really the Eternal Being, the Lord of the Universe.\nBhagavad Gita 4.6 by Swami Sarvapriyananda\nSwami Vivekananda Says —\nThen Krishna says, “O Arjuna, you and I have run the cycle of births and deaths many times, but you are not conscious of them all.

Between knowing and becoming, there is no distinction in Brahmavidya. It is different in the objective world; there the knower and the known are different. But in the realm of the Self, knowing and becoming are one. In other words, only he who knows Him becomes Brahman. But what is this knowing of Brahman? It is certainly not an intellectual conclusion, drawn by logic and argument from a study of the Sastras. One may be convinced by the logical argument that Brahman alone is real, and yet he may be far far away from realising Him. This is not knowledge of Brahman. Knowing Brahman means the direct experience of Atma which is beyond the body, senses mind and intellect. This is to know Brahman in the essence (Tattatah).\nIn this verse, the Lord states that he who knows the essential principle of His divine birth and action enters Him and has no further birth. By deep mediation and ecstasy of devotion, man becomes one with the Lord.\nTo know the nature of the Lord is\nSadhana\n, and to become one with Him is\nSadhya\n.

Here Jnana is described as tapas, a penance of wonderful merit because it cleanses all accumulated sins of previous births and all the impurities of inherited instincts, impulses and tendencies. Such men who are purified by this penance are mentioned as purified (\nPutah\n). What are the marks of this Jnana tapas? Freedom from desire, fear and hatred, intense devotion and absorption in the Lord, seeking ultimate refuge in Him, – these are the aspects of Jnana tapas. What is its effect? Attaining the Lord, Self-realisation through purity is the reward.\nFree from desire, fear and hatred:\nAttachment to worldly objects, fear and hatred, form the triple-headed monster who should be killed and destroyed. Is it an easy task? How to destroy them? The Lord points the way. He says, ‘think of me, be absolved in me, take refuge in me.’ That is the way to conquer the enemy. As man acquires greater and greater firmness in Jnana, these obstacles are gradually cleared from the mind, and that very moment when the mind is destroyed, the supreme Self is realised. When the mind ceases to exist, Self is realised, and when Self is realised, mind ceases to exist. So one should practice the two aspects of Jnana simultaneously.",

So men worship the Devas like Indra, Varuna etc., and offer sacrifices to them, and the fruits of such works are quickly attained and enjoyed. All the other worlds are places of enjoyment resulting from the work done here. The earth is the world of action (Karma Bhumi) for good or evil. Men attain Heaven or Hell according to the good or evil done by them in this world. When that experience is over, they take birth once again in this world. So this is the centre for spiritual realisation. Let all the seekers take to good work, purify their minds, and attain Knowledge.\nIf the sick man does not cure himself where is medicine for his disease, what can he do when he goes to a place where there is no medicine? So the wise man should undertake some form of spiritual discipline in this world and attain liberation from the disease of birth and death.\nBhagavad Gita 4.12 by Swami Sarvapriyananda\nPeople longing for worldly success worship minor gods or angels, who also are manifestations of the Lord. But on account of their selfish motives, their mode of worship is characterized by the attitude that the devotee and the god are two different beings. “He who, on the other hand, worships a separate god, thinking, ‘He is separate from me and I am separate from him’— he knows not. He is to the gods as cattle are to men.” (Brihadāranyaka Upanishad, I, iv, 10) Worldly success is quickly and easily attained, but not so Self-knowledge. Therefore people do not seek the latter.\nSwami Vivekananda Says —\nThey are good-natured, kind, and truthful. All is right with them, but that enjoyment is their God. It is a country where money flows like a river, with beauty as its ripple and learning its waves, and which rolls in luxury. “Longing for success in action, in this world, (men) worship the deities. For success is quickly attained through action in this world of man.” Here you have a wonderful manifestation of grit and power — what strength, what practicality, and what manhood! Horses huge as elephants are drawing carriages that are as big as houses. You may take this as a specimen of the gigantic proportions in other things also. Here is a manifestation of tremendous energy.\n[Source]\nSrimad Bhagavatam 10.88.8-11\n8. The worshipful Lord said: He on whom I am going to bestow my grace, I slowly deprive him of all his wealth. When his wealth is gone, his friends and kith and kin desert him, making him sink into utmost sorrow and despair.\n9. When his further efforts to gain wealth also fail, thanks to My will, he becomes filled with dispassion and gets association with My devotees. On such a one I bestow My grace.\n10. For this reason people do not adore Me, the Supreme Brahman, who is extremely subtle, being of the nature of pure Existence-Consciousness-Bliss, unlimited and impossible to be conceived with an impure heart. Men therefore adopt usually the worship of other deities.\n11. As a consequence, they obtain soon from those easily propitiated deities kingdom, wealth and such worldly blessings and become so filled with arrogance and infatuation thereby that they forget themselves to the extent of disregarding and becoming oblivious even of the deity who favoured them.\nSwami Turiyananda: “Animal bodies are for the experience of pleasure or pain only (the result of past work). No fresh work (Karma) can be done through them. When the present body is gone, animals will take on another body by drawing upon the storehouse of their past work (Sanchita Karma). Animals have no conscience, hence they have no merit or demerit. They have obviously got intelligence, but there it ends. Only men can do fresh work, because they have got a conscience. They only have got the idea of bondage, which other creatures have not. Only when there is the idea of bondage, can there be any real effort for liberation. Don’t you see how a prisoner struggles for release? It is only when there is the idea that the world is a bondage, that a man can strive for liberation. His failure to understand this takes him through the endless cycles of births and deaths. ….\n….”Even saints may slip and become bound, as for instance,\nJada Bharata\n. Self-exertion is needed to snap the bondage. It is self-exertion that brings about quick results; otherwise there is no knowing when success will come. ‘Last birth’ means that one will realize God in this very life. Ignorance is without beginning, for one cannot trace its origin.\n“Once Girish Bâbu put the question to the Master, ‘Why have you to practise so hard?’ The Master replied: ‘You know, there is eternal union of Hara (Shiva) with Gauri. Still, why did she practise so much austerity? All that was as an example to others. If I do so much, others will do at least one-sixteenth part of it? Is it not so ?” (Source: Spiritual Talks by the First Disciples of Sri Ramakrishna)\n[\nJada Bharata\n: Jada Bharata was a great monarch in one of his previous births. In that birth when he retired in his old age from the duties of the King to lead a life of contemplation in a forest he became attached to the young one of a deer which had lost its mother. As a result he turned away from God and in his next birth was born as a deer. In his birth after that he was again born as a man and attained realization. In this last birth he was known as Jada Bharata for he lived as one inert and idiotic for fear of getting bound again by worldly ties. ]\nBhagavad Gita: Chapter 4 🔻\n(42 Verses)\n01\n02\n03\n04\n05\n06\n07\n08\n09\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\nRelated Articles:\nChandogya Upanishad 8.1.5",

    "translation": "Who sees action in inaction and inaction in action, he is the wise man, the yogi, the doer of all actions among men.",
    "commentary": "No action in action:\nIf a man learns to work without the feeling of doership and without desire to enjoy the fruits thereof, he attains complete freedom. Any kind of work, and any amount of it, cannot bind him. So what he does amounts to no action or inaction, just because he knows that he is not doing anything at all, but that the bodily and mental organs and instruments are functioning according to their nature in their own fields of activity. Let us take the illustration of a mirror. Various objects and various forms of action are reflected in it constantly, and yet the minor is not tainted in any way; it remains clear and pure. Even so, the Jnani knows that he is the all-pervading Self and in that Self all actions of the universe are taking place just like those reflected in the mirror. Thus we find that several sages and great men have done great good to mankind through detached and desireless action. Their action, from this point of view, is no action at all so far as they are concerned, as they have entered the Self – state beyond the physical and mental planes. The ignorant man may attribute action to him because he is confused and does not know the secret which the Jnani understands in all the actions. It is this philosophical position which is stated in this apparently paradoxical sentence.\nAction in no action:\nExactly opposite to these wise men are the idlers who apparently do not do any work but are constantly in a state of action. The idlers refuse to do any work; they are too lazy or too weak in body to perform any work. They may pose as philosophers and Jnanis because their bodily and sense organs are not engaged in any work. But they are always in a state of action because their minds wander about all over the world, think and perform a thousand forms of work, and they live a restless and tortured life. The inherent samskaras play havoc with their mind-stuff which is the root cause of samsara, birth and death. They have not arrived at that state of peace and restfulness which belongs to the highest realm of the Self. The Lord warns the seeker not to fall into this horrible error. Otherwise, man does the greatest injury to himself by confounding the positive peace of self-realisation with the negative state of inaction of the body which is the same as death. He should understand that detachment is a mental attitude born of knowledge and not merely cessation of work. It is not action that binds but egotism and the past evil tendencies of the mind. The body is after all an external instrument. The operator is the mind. It is here that detachment should be cultivated. To restrain the sense-organs and go on thinking of sense pleasures and enjoyments with the mind, is\n`midhyachara’\nand Lord has already condemned such men in the Discourse of Karma yoga. The same idea is presented here in a different context.\nSo, the realised man, whether he is working or not working enjoys the supreme peace of the Self. He gets the highest reward of performing all the good works enjoined by the Sastras. He is rooted in the Self in action and in inaction. For such a man action is not action.\nThe Lord eulogises the sage who has attained this state as `\nbuddhiman\n‘ , ‘\nyuktah’\nand\n‘kristnakarmakrit’\n. By following the path of nishkama karma, he has purified his mind and attained the Atmic state and by that, he has achieved the highest goal of life. For such a man there is nothing more to do, and therefore he is said to have performed all the works enjoined by the Sastras (kristnakarmakrit).\nBhagavad Gita 4.18 by Swami Sarvapriyananda\nSwami Vivekananda Says —\nKrishna preached in the midst of the battlefield. “He who in the midst of intense activity finds himself in the greatest calmness, and in the greatest peace finds intense activity, that is the greatest [\nyogi\nas well as the wisest man].”\n[Source]\nEverything goes to show that this philosophy must be very practical; and later on, when we come to the\nBhagavad Gita\n— most of you, perhaps, have read it, it is the best commentary we have on the Vedanta philosophy — curiously enough the scene is laid on the battlefield, where Krishna teaches this philosophy to Arjuna; and the doctrine which stands out luminously in every page of the Gita is intense activity, but in the midst of it, eternal calmness. This is the secret of work, to attain which is the goal of the Vedanta. Inactivity, as we understand it in the sense of passivity, certainly cannot be the goal. Were it so, then the walls around us would be the most intelligent; they are inactive. Clods of earth, stumps of trees, would be the greatest sages in the world; they are inactive. Nor does inactivity become activity when it is combined with passion. Real activity, which is the goal of Vedanta, is combined with eternal calmness, the calmness which cannot be ruffled, the balance of mind which is never disturbed, whatever happens. And we all know from our experience in life that that is the best attitude for work.\n[Source]\n“He who sees in the midst of intense activity, intense calm, and in the midst of intensest peace is intensely active [is wise indeed]. … This is the question: With every sense and every organ active, have you that tremendous peace [so that] nothing can disturb you? Standing on Market Street, waiting for the car with all the rush … going on around you, are you in meditation — calm and peaceful? In the cave, are you intensely active there with all quiet about you? If you are, you are a\nyogi\n, otherwise not.\n[Source]\nThe ideal man is he who, in the midst of the greatest silence and solitude, finds the intensest activity, and in the midst of the intensest activity finds the silence and solitude of the desert. He has learnt the secret of restraint, he has controlled himself. He goes through the streets of a big city with all its traffic, and his mind is as calm as if he were in a cave, where not a sound could reach him; and he is intensely working all the time. That is the ideal of\nkarma-yoga\n, and if you have attained to that you have really learnt the secret of work.\n[Source]\n“He who in the midst of the greatest activity finds the sweetest peace, and in the midst of the greatest calmness is most active, he has known the secret of life.” Krishna shows the way how to do this — by being non-attached: do everything but do not get identified with anything. You are the soul, the pure, the free, all the time; you are the Witness. Our misery comes, not from work, but by our getting attached to something.\n[Source]\nWhen we come to that non-attachment, then we can understand the marvellous mystery of the universe; how it is intense activity and vibration, and at the same time intensest peace and calm; how it is work every moment and rest every moment. That is the mystery of the universe — the impersonal and personal in one, the infinite and finite in one. Then we shall find the secret. “He who finds in the midst of intense activity the greatest rest, and in the midst of the greatest rest intense activity, he has become a\nyogi\n.” He alone is a real worker, none else. We do a little work and break ourselves. Why? We become attached to that work. If we do not become attached, side by side with it we have infinite rest.\n[Source]\nTherefore Krishna teaches us not to shirk our duties, but to take them up manfully, and not think of the result. The servant has no right to question. The soldier has no right to reason. Go forward, and do not pay too much attention to the nature of the work you have to do. Ask your mind if you are unselfish. If you are, never mind anything, nothing can resist you! Plunge in! Do the duty at hand. And when you have done this, by degrees you will realize the Truth: “Whosoever in the midst of intense activity finds intense peace, whosoever in the midst of the greatest peace finds the greatest activity, he is a\nyogi\n, he is a great soul, he has arrived at perfection.”\n[Source]\nMost of us cannot keep our activities on a par with our thought-lives. Some blessed ones can. Most of us seem to lose the power of work as we think deeper, and the power of deep thought if we work more. That is why most great thinkers have to leave to time the practical realization of their great ideals. Their thoughts must wait for more active brains to work them out and spread them. Yet, as we write, comes before us a vision of him, the charioteer of Arjuna, standing in his chariot between the contending hosts, his left hand curbing the fiery steeds — a mail-clad warrior, whose eagle-glance sweeps over the vast army, and as if by instinct weighs every detail of the battle array of both parties — at the same time that we hear, as it were, falling from his lips and thrilling the awe-struck Arjuna, that most marvellous secret of work: “He who finds rest in the midst of activity, and activity in rest, he is the wise amidst men, he the\nyogi\n, he is the doer of all work.”\n[Source]",

(3) He does not depend upon anything (i.e. Atma alone is his sole refuge). Such a man, though he is deeply engaged in a thousand activities, is really not doing anything at all. Several sages and Mahatmas have done immortal work for the good of humanity in that spirit.\nThey are not attached to the fruits of work, because they have surrendered everything to the Lord. They are ever content because they experience the bliss of the Self beyond which there is no delight anywhere at all. Their content is not conditioned by time, place, and circumstances and therefore they are ever content\n‘nityatriptah’\n. The ignorant man is always seeking refuge in this or that material object because the gross mind can only exist by clinging to such gross objects however wretched they might be. Without such a prop, he cannot live. That is why man clings to objects in spite of all the suffering that they caused both by possession and non-possession. The wise man, on the other hand, has found his abode of peace in Atma, and never falls down to the plane of the matter though he lives in a physical body. For such a man action is no action. Lord Krishna exhorts Arjuna to find that state and live in it while carrying out all the duties which he is called upon to perform by his earthly position as a human being.\nBhagavad Gita 4.20 by Swami Sarvapriyananda\nSwami Vivekananda Says —\n“Giving up all attachment to work, always satisfied, not hoping for gain, the wise man acts and is beyond action.”\n[Source]",

The man who has no desire to enjoy the pleasures of the objective world has his mind turned inwards in the contemplation of Atma. He finds all happiness there. So even though he works he cannot have any attachment for the fruits of work. Self-control leads to Atmajnana. When the senses and the mind are restrained, naturally man becomes free from the enticing temptation of the material world with all its glamour and attraction. When such a man works, he has no feeling of attachment for any material object at all. The third attribute `\naparigraha\n‘ should be carefully noted by the aspirant. Non-receiving of gifts and possessions is enjoined by the Sastras as a very important discipline for the seeker. When one receives gifts from others he takes with them part of the karma of the giver. The very purpose of the seeker (i.e.) to get rid of karma is defeated. Why should he add to his own load the sins of others by receiving worthless possessions of material things?

These qualities distinguish the Jivanmukta and the perfect Karma yogi.\nWork and wisdom, knowledge and action, are interdependent. It is only the man of knowledge who can be a perfect Karma yogi. Unless one acquires the knowledge of the Self, it is impossible to work without attachment, to go beyond the pairs of opposites, and to be free from the evil of malice. Thus the Jnani who is acting in the world is not bound by karma. How is this knowledge of Self to be attained? Unless a man undertakes selfless, desireless work, he cannot obtain purity of mind, and unless the mind is purified of all its evil tendencies of ‘raga and dvesha’, he cannot realise Atma. So these two aspects go together in the spiritual progress of man towards perfection. That is the reason why at the end of the Third Discourse on Karma yoga, the Lord declares the perfection of Self-realisation, and here in Jnana yoga, the secret of Karma yoga is emphasised prominently.\nThe Jnani is in a state of absorption in the Self, and so what he does with the bodily vehicle cannot bind him. He knows clearly that he has nothing to gain or lose by action or inaction because he is united with Brahman. As long as the body lasts, its maintenance is carried on automatically without any samkalpa on his part. In this way, the bodily vehicle and the mental instruments are used for the good of humanity without egotism or any sense of personal doership. Such a man is not bound by what he does.\nBhagavad Gita 4.22 by Swami Sarvapriyananda\nSri Ramakrishna Says —\nMASTER:\n“It is by no means necessary for a man always to be engaged in his duties. Actions drop away when one realises God, as the flower drops of itself when the fruit appears.\n(\nBG 3.17\n,\nBG 3.18\n)\n“He who has realised God no longer performs religious duties such as the sandhya. In his case the sandhya merges in the Gayatri. When that happens, it is enough for a person to repeat just the Gayatri mantra. Then the Gayatri merges in Om. After that one no longer chants even the Gayatri; it is enough then to chant simply Om. How long should a man practise such devotions as the sandhya? As long as he does not feel a thrill in his body and shed tears of joy while repeating the name of Rama or of Hari. People worship God to win money or a lawsuit. That is not good.”\nA DEVOTEE:\n“We find that everyone strives after money. Even Keshab Sen married his daughter to a prince.”\nMASTER:\n“Keshab’s case is quite different.\nGod provides everything for a genuine devotee, even without his making any effort. The son of a real king gets his monthly allowance. I am not talking of lawyers and men of that sort, who go through suffering in order to earn money, and who become slaves of others to that end. I am speaking of a real prince. A true devotee has no desire. He does not care for money. Money comes to him of itself. The\nGita\ndescribes such a devotee as ‘content with what comes to him without effort’. A good brahmin, without any personal motive, can accept food even from the house of an untouchable. He does not desire it; it comes of its own accord.\n” (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)\n—–\nSometimes Ramakrishna tested M.’s understanding of specific terms that he used. On 3 August 1884 the Master talked about false and real renunciation. Because M. was a family man, it was not possible for him to renounce completely, so the Master asked him to renounce mentally.\nM.:\n“Mental renunciation is prescribed for those who cannot give up the world outwardly. For superior devotees total renunciation is enjoined — both outer and inner.”\nRamakrishna was silent for a few minutes and then resumed the conversation.",

    "translation": "Of the man who is devoid of attachment, who is liberated, whose mind is established in knowledge, the whole action performed in the spirit of sacrifice is dissolved.",
    "commentary": "The essential qualities of the man of Knowledge are described here (1) Non-attachment, (2) freedom from desire and hatred, attraction and repulsion, (3) absorption in Atma, (4) performing work in a spirit of sacrifice. The Karma of the sage who possesses these qualities is entirely dissolved.\nWhose mind is established in Knowledge:\nThe mind of the sage is established in Knowledge. Such Knowledge is the result of non-attachment to the fruits of work, and liberation from agitations of desire and hatred. For such a man, though he is engaged in a thousand actions, all that he does is totally dissolved in the ocean of Knowledge. So it is clear that Knowledge of Self is the only way to cut the bonds of karma. Without true Knowledge, man is inevitably bound to the material world through his unrestrained senses and mind and what he does is motivated by desire and egotism, and so he binds himself to the wheel of samsara. This bondage is the creation of man’s own mind and is not the effect of the objective world. In fact, the objective world exists as it is, and man attaches himself to it by his past samskaras and suffers the unavoidable consequences of birth and death. The sage has discovered the original freedom of his own Self and so he has released himself from the enslaving forces of the senses and the mind. Such a man is not bound by karma, because there is no desire for personal enjoyment and there is no feeling of doership. His work is thus dissolved in Knowledge.\nPerformed in the spirit of sacrifice:\nIn the Third Discourse, it has already been stated that work done with any other motive except as dedicated to the Lord, as Dharma or as service to humanity, will cause bondage.\nIt dissolved:\nIt is emphatically stated here that nothing remains of karma for the man who has realised Brahman. Sanchita and Agami karma are destroyed in the fire of Knowledge. Only Prarabdha remains as long as the body lasts, and when the body falls, it is all over. There is no mind, no karma to lead to further births.\nThese ideas are a source of great thought for the man of action, the devotee, and the aspirant for liberation. All of these are seeking emancipation from the bondage of karma. And the message of the Gita is not the abandoning of action but the freedom of man through right action. The secret is revealed how a man should work and yet remain free from being caught in the meshes of karma.\nBhagavad Gita 4.23 by Swami Sarvapriyananda\nBhagavad Gita: Chapter 4 🔻\n(42 Verses)\n01\n02\n03\n04\n05\n06\n07\n08\n09\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42",

    "commentary": "Realizing Brahman in All Actions | Swami Sarvapriyananda\nEverything in the yajna is Brahman. The verse enunciates the Upanishadic truth.\nAll this is Brahman –\nSarvam khalvidam brahma\n(\nChandogya Upanishad\n3.14.1\n).\nKeeping this truth in mind one should work; yajna is Brahman in every part and in all its details.\nIf all this – the whole universe with all the beings in it and all the actions taking place in it – is Brahman, the One Reality without a second, why and wherefore the manifoldness? Name and form (nama and rupa) have super-imposed the diversity on the supreme Brahman. What is superimposed cannot change the nature of the original substance. The snake that is superimposed on the rope out of the delusion of the eye cannot change the nature of the rope. The rope remains the rope even when the snake is superimposed on it by the illusion of the eye. When the illusion passes away by focussing the light on the object, the rope is seen and known as the rope. So, all the time what existed was the rope only and nothing else. Even so, the world of name and form has been superimposed by the delusion of the mind and the senses on the supreme Brahman. When the delusion is cleared and the mind is purified, all this shall be seen and known as Brahman. The sage knows the truth. Everything that we see, feel, and think, and every action of ours is Brahman and nothing exists other than Brahman. It is this fundamental truth that is affirmed in this verse by the illustration of yajna. The oblation is Brahman. The material used is Brahman. The fire is Brahman. The sacrifice is Brahman. The act of sacrifice is Brahman. Thus contemplating, man realises Brahman everywhere and in all things.\nYajna\nis taken as an illustration because at the end of Dvaparayuga, sacrifices were performed elaborately by all people and they were familiar with the rites and rituals. The principle is applicable to everything and every action that man does. He is blessed who acts in the understanding and experience of the truth that all is Brahman.\nBy absorption:\nHere the technique of transforming all work into Brahman is indicated. By concentration and meditation, by constant absorption in Brahman, every kind of work that is done melts into Brahman. Work then loses its separate limited quality, its binding power. It acquires a divine and spiritual quality. The distinction between karma and jnana is thus eliminated, and Brahman alone is realised in all that one thinks and does. The seeker should understand the importance of this verse which shows the direct path to Brahmajnana. Any man in any work of life doing any kind of work can practice this method and reach the goal. There is a tradition among people to repeat this verse while taking food. The food is Brahman, the feeder is Brahman, and the act of eating is Brahman. It is again an affirmation that everything and every act is That, appearing to be manifold by the super-imposition of name and form.\nBhagavad Gita 4.24 by Swami Sarvapriyananda\nSri Ramakrishna Says —\nKedar sang several other songs. After the music the Master again talked to the devotees. Nandalal, Keshab’s nephew, was also present with a few Brahmo friends. They were sitting near the Master.\nMASTER (\nto Vijay and the other devotees\n): “A man brought a bottle of consecrated wine for me; but I couldn’t even touch it.”\nVIJAY: “Ah!”\nMASTER: “I become intoxicated at the mere thought of God. I don’t have to take any wine. I feel drunk at the very sight of the charanamrita.\n5\nI feel as if I had drunk five bottles of liquor. When a person attains such a state he cannot help discriminating about food.”\nNARENDRA: “As regards food, one should take whatever comes.”\nMASTER: “What you say applies only to a particular state of the aspirant’s mind. No food can harm a jnani.\nAccording to the\nGita\n, the jnani himself does not eat; his eating is an offering to the Kundalini.\nBut that does not apply to a bhakta. The present state of my mind is such that I cannot eat any food unless it is first offered to God by a brahmin priest. Formerly my state of mind was such that I would enjoy inhaling the smell of burning corpses, carried by the wind from the other side of the Ganges. It tasted very sweet to me. But nowadays I cannot eat food touched by anybody and everybody. No, I cannot. But once in a while I do. One day I was taken to see a performance of a play at Keshab’s house. They gave me luchi and curries to eat. I didn’t know whether the food was handed to me by a washerman or a barber; but I ate quite a little. (\nAll laugh\n.) Rakhal had asked me to eat. (\nTo Narendra\n) “With you it is all right. You are in ‘this’ as well as in ‘that’.\n6\nYou can eat everything now. (\nTo the devotees\n) Blessed is he who feels longing for God, though he eats pork. But shame on him whose mind dwells on ‘woman and gold’, though he eats the purest food — boiled vegetables, rice, and ghee.

They worship different Gods, meditate on them, pray to them and in many ways please the Gods. They may be termed Karmayogis or Bhaktiyogis.\n(2) Others perform sacrifice to Brahman by offering his separate individuality (jiva) as oblation in the fire of Brahman. Fire consumes everything and converts all into its own element. Similarly, the whole of the objective world melts into Brahman. The mind and ego are also objective phenomena pertaining to the inner nature of man. So the yogis offer them as oblation in the fire of Brahman (i.e.) they are absorbed into Brahman and lose their separate limited personalities. These are the Jnanayogis. This sacrifice leads to identity with Brahman ultimately. By inquiring into the real nature of man, by indisposition towards the objects of the world, by the eradication of bad samskaras, the mind which keeps up the illusion of duality is so purified that it is merged in Brahman. This is the liberated state of the jnanayogi.

    "commentary": "Here two types of yajna are mentioned -(1) restraining the senses (2) rejecting the sense – objects.\nSense – restraint is the key to Brahmajnana, – and so the Lord insists on this discipline many times in the Gita.\nSo, sense control is the first of all spiritual disciplines. Vedantic perorations without sense-control do not have either light or power in them. The man of sense-control, though he does not talk anything, communicates Vedantic truth to the ends of the world even without one spoken word. The sense-control is here mentioned as a sacrifice. Liberation can be attained only by mind-control. and this depends on sense restraint. By practising several kinds of penance by following several vows. rules and regulations of conduct, the seeker should get the senses under control. This is what is meant by sacrificing the senses in the fire of restraint. The plural form ‘fires’ is used because there are different senses to be controlled.\nThe second yajna mentioned here is closely related to the first. The senses, according to their nature, wander about freely in the objective world, experiencing pleasure and pain through pleasant and unpleasant objects. Therefore one has to reject the sense objects by deeply examining them and understanding how painful and worthless they are. When one realises the worthlessness and shadowy nature of these sense objects, the senses do not run after them. They remain steadfast in their own seats. It is the rushing out of the senses towards material objects that disturbs the mind and throws it into a state of commotion. When the senses are kept in their place, the mind is calm and when the mind is calm, the bliss of Alma is experienced. This is sacrificing the sense-objects in the fire of the senses.\nBhagavad Gita 4.26 by Swami Sarvapriyananda",

By its inherent samskaras acquired through several births, the mind has become a thick dark veil covering up the Reality and preventing the people from knowing their own real nature.

Otherwise, the force of the senses and the ill-regulated health disturb the mind-stuff endlessly.

This idea – is figuratively described as sacrificing the senses and the vital energy (prana) in the fire of self-control.\nIllumined by Knowledge:\nJnana is compared to light. By sense-control and self-control, the light of knowledge shines brightest. On the other side, by discrimination and knowledge of the Self, the mind is brought under control. Therefore it is here said that self-control is illumined by knowledge. The fire of self-control is fawned into flame by knowledge. It means that those who aspire for mind-control should practise discrimination and enquiry into the Self. The seeker has to carry on the enquiry – “what and whence this universe? what is the reality behind all this?” By such enquiry, the mind ceases to run after the transitory things of the objective world and turns towards that which is the basis of all – Atma. It is evident from this epithet that the Atmic state is the absolute fulness of light, knowledge and bliss.\nBhagavad Gita 4.27 by Swami Sarvapriyananda",

Pranayama is often accompanied with some holy mantra like OM.\nBreathing (Prana) is closely connected with the operations of the mind. It is everybody’s experience. When a gust of passion disturbs the mind, the breath becomes at once irregular, and as the passion cools down the breath also becomes normal. When the breath is irregular owing to some physical exertion, it is again impossible to concentrate the mind. So regularity of breathing always accompanies mental concentration. By controlling the breath, the mind is also controlled. For this reason, breath control is prescribed as a healthy and helpful practice in spiritual life. The seeker has to learn the technique from a competent master. Here breath-control is mentioned as a form of sacrifice.\nBhagavad Gita 4.29 by Swami Sarvapriyananda",

    "commentary": "Thus far the Lord has explained twelve different types of yajnas. Of these, the last two are the regulation and control of food – habits. No one should commit the mistake of doubting what connection there is between food and spiritual attainment. Without fear of any exaggeration, it can be asserted that food is the first thing about which the seeker should be extremely careful. Otherwise, all his effort will come to naught. Over-eating or under-eating, eating at all odd times, in all places, all types of food from all kinds of persons, – all these should be carefully avoided. It is food that is turned into physical energy which in its turn is turned into mental energy that leads to spiritual illumination. Impure food not only unhinges the physical body but also irritates and provokes all kinds of undesirable humours which are detrimental to self-control. Some kinds of food like meat, garlic, and spices induce physical aberration like indulgence in sex and irritability of temper, cruelty in word and deed, and other discordant impulses. They are all obstacles to spiritual progress.\nJust as a loose nut in a complicated machine brings it to a standstill, just as a train meets with disaster if one of the sleepers is taken off, even so the whole system of spiritual life is disrupted if care is not taken about food. If the food is pure, the mind is pure; if the mind is pure, liberation is attained. The Lord here mentions that regulation of food is also a yajna. There are five conditions to determine the quality of food (1) purity (2) moderation, (3) righteous earning, (4) offering to the Lord, and (5) timeliness.\nThe Lord has described various spiritual disciplines and each of them is given the sacred name of yajna. We understand that the old concept of yajna as a Vedic ritual accompanied by elaborate technique is given up, and a new significance is attached to other forms of discipline. Besides, it is here affirmed that all those who practise any of these disciplines are knowers of sacrifice\n(vajnavidah)\n.\nWhat then is the use of yajnas? It is the first and last method of purification. All the sins of the past and all the evil tendencies of the mind are destroyed by yajna. So it is imperative that the seeker should undertake some form of discipline and strive to attain purity which alone can lead him to Self realisation.\nBhagavad Gita 4.30 by Swami Sarvapriyananda",

    "translation": "Those who eat the remnants of sacrifice which is nectar, go to eternal Brahman; to the non- sacrificer, even this world is not, how then can he get a higher world?",
    "commentary": "Thus far having explained various yajnas, the Lord now states their great merit. The remnants of food offered as sacrifice are equal to nectar, and by tasting it one reaches eternal Brahman. So the seeker should perform some form of yajna, some devotional act, some righteous deed, some oblation to the Divine, and then only should he take his food. Such food confers immortality. It has already been said that yajna destroys all sin and evil. Now the highest reward is offered to the sacrificer- the attainment of Brahman. The purified mind merges in Atma, and Atma alone shines in its original untainted light. This is the Atmic state, the realisation of Brahman. How wonderful is the fruit of sacrifice!\nThe greatness of the result is proof of the excellence of the cause. Yajna is the cause and the result is the direct realisation of Brahman. In this world, man endures all troubles for the purpose of acquiring a bit of wealth or pleasure or fame. After all, they are brief and short-lived. But the knowledge of Self is an eternal blessing for man. Should we not aspire for it? If the same energy one expends for possessing this or that worldly object, is directed towards the spiritual goal, man can achieve the highest even in this life. The Lord has offered ample choice in selecting the yajna most available to each individual. Various paths are open for this spiritual quest. Let people be alert and watchful, and they shall attain the goal.\nThe non- sacrificer loses both worlds. What enjoyment or happiness or joy can he have even in this world? Indisciplined men who have neither will nor knowledge cannot hope to make anything even in this earthly life. It is all misery, doubt and despair for them, and such men proceed from sorrow to sorrow. It should be understood that success in attaining purity is also the fruit of sacrifice (i.e.,) the result of self-discipline and proper action. If one cannot do this, how can one hope to enter a higher world? The Lord calls on mankind – “O ye mortal beings! Having attained this human birth, if you do nothing for your spiritual uplift, you cannot get anything even in this life, much less in the next world.”\nThose who eat the remnant of sacrifice:\nFood is not a necessary ingredient in such yajnas like sense-restraint, self-control, pranayama, etc. So in these cases, the word food may be understood as the nectar of peace and joy arising from spiritual practices.\nBhagavad Gita 4.31 by Swami Sarvapriyananda",

    "commentary": "Not only those types of yajna mentioned before but many more are elaborately described in the Vedas which have originated from the supreme Brahman.\nBorn of action:\nThese sacrifices are all different modes of action. Speech is action, thought is action, work done with the body is action, the operation of the senses is action. So, action well-planned and executed with resolution is the cause of yajna. Individual effort is essential for the performance of Yajna. Inaction leads to nothing. Spirituality is indeed a practical science and not an empty talk. So the seekers should use each one of their faculties, physical and mental, for the purpose of performing these sacrifices. Such determined action alone can yield the highest fruit of liberation. The Lord exhorts all mankind to take to a life of action, perform yajna, purify the mind, and attain Brahman. In fact, the despondency of Arjuna was a cowardly renunciation of action which he thought was a state of jnana. The Lord explains that such spurious and sentimental inaction is a sign of ignorance, and on the other side, one should act fearlessly and selflessly, so that the path may be opened for spiritual Knowledge in due course. When man comes to understand that all yajnas are modes of action, then he is liberated.\nBhagavad Gita 4.32 by Swami Sarvapriyananda",

    "translation": "O scorcher of foes! Knowledge-sacrifice is superior to sacrifice performed with objects. All actions, O Arjuna, in their entirety, culminate in Knowledge.",
    "commentary": "Jnana – yajna implies enquiry into the Truth, the pursuit of reality. Discrimination between Atma and Anatma, the Seer and the Seen, hearing of Truth, thinking and meditating on Truth, restraining the senses, controlling the mind, the destruction of the latent tendencies, all these are comprehended by the term Jnana Yajna.\nDravya yajna means sacrifice performed with the aid of material objects. It is here said that Jnana Yajna is superior to Dravya Yajna. The reason is that hat Self-realisation (Atma Jnana), is the ultimate goal of all embodied beings. Man has forgotten his real nature by ignorance, and to become aware of his real Self is the object of all religions and philosophy. All religious practices lead finally to this knowledge. The fruits of all sacrifices are comprehended in Self-Knowledge, the supreme bliss and blessedness of Brahman. So whatever fruits are obtainable by the performance of Dravya Yajna are fully and completely realised in Brahma Jnana. Therefore it is declared that Jnana Yajna is superior to all others. It is the yajna par excellence.\nThe end of all forms of Karma is knowledge. The sacrifices purify the mind, remove all sins, and in that way render Self – Knowledge possible. And, just as the rivers join the ocean, so also all the works with their fruits are merged in Brahman.\nThe idea is that the fruits of karma are not destroyed but fully realised in the bliss of Brahma Jnana.\nSo every man should strive for wisdom, and towards that end, he should take the aid of Yajna in the form of some good works. Whatever may be the practice followed, its goal is wisdom. At some time or other, everyone should acquire this knowledge by which he attains liberation.\nKarma is ‘sadhana’ knowledge is\n‘sadhya’\n. Karma takes man to the threshold of Jnana, and Jnana lifts him up to the heights of the liberated state. From this, we understand that liberation is not a sudden blast of knowledge, but the end of a long process of good and righteous action. By ceaseless devotion to God, man acquires His grace, and He by his infinite compassion opens the eye of wisdom in man and Atma is then perceived. Even after self-realisation, some wise men continue to work for the benefit of humanity. Thus in this verse, the excellence of Jnana and the need for Karma are both emphasised.\nBhagavad Gita 4.33 by Swami Sarvapriyananda\nSwami Vivekananda Says —\nAs to the so-called Hindu idolatry — first go and learn the forms they are going through, and where it is that the worshippers are really worshipping, whether in the temple, in the image, or in the temple of their own bodies. First know for certain what they are doing — which more than ninety per cent of the revilers are thoroughly ignorant of — and then it will explain itself in the light of the Vedantic philosophy. Still these karmas are not compulsory. On the other hand, open your Manu and see where it orders every old man to embrace the fourth ashrama, and whether he embraces it or not, he must give up all karma. It is reiterated everywhere that all these karmas “finally end in jnana”.\n[Source]",

    "translation": "O Arjuna! Having obtained this knowledge, you will not thus be deluded again and by this Knowledge, you will see all beings in your Self and also in Me.",
    "commentary": "The Knowledge received from the Brahmanishta Guru consists of (1) the removal of all former delusions forever, and (2) the perception of all beings in one’s own Self and also in God. Let us understand these two aspects in Jnana.\n(1) The proof of having eyes is not to fall into the pit. If a person falls, it is clear that he cannot see. Thus the proof of Brahmajnana is the clearing away of all delusions which have been haunting man from time immemorial.\nAtma, the Self, is alone real and all else is an illusion. To know this from experience is Jnana.\nHow can that wise man be deluded again? He sees everything as his own Self and knows that there is nothing else but the Self. All this is one indivisible ocean of Sachidananda.\nWhen the mango is raw it is sour and bitter. But when it becomes ripe, it is sweet all over. Thus in the deluded state when man sees the manifold world, there is fear and hatred, and sorrow and suffering. But when all is seen as Atma, as God Himself, there can be no delusion, and when there is no delusion, there is no sorrow. Arjuna was deluded when he saw his relations and friends, and sorrow possessed him at the awful vision of their destruction on the battle-field. The Lord teaches him that he would never again be the victim of such delusion any time thereafter when he obtained Brahmajnana from the Master.\nThe sine qua non of wisdom is freedom from delusion and any kind of attachment to sense pleasures. The Lord emphasised the need for practice and realisation and exposes the pretensions of those for whom religion is mere talk and verbal jugglery. It is practice that counts. The seeker should constantly examine himself: Am I free from delusion? Am I free from pride and arrogance? Am I free from envy towards other people’s fame and prosperity? Is there hatred and anger in me? How far have I overcome my sensual nature? In this way, everyone should thoroughly cleanse his mind day after day and purify the senses and the mind. There is no other way.\nThe aspiration for the higher Self should be strengthened in order to overcome the desires of one’s lower nature. ‘Aim at the highest, do the best, and success is assured in due course.’ This is the Lord’s exhortation to all mankind in the Gita.\n(2) The second aspect of the Jnana is that the sage of steady wisdom is able to see the whole universe in his own Self and also in God. The whole universe with all its elements moving and unmoving is superimposed on Atma which is the basic Reality. When the rope is mistaken for a snake, what is the reality on which the delusion is based? The rope is the reality. So the snake which is superimposed by one’s delusion is not different from the rope. Even so, the super-imposed universe is not really different from Brahman. This being so, the wise man sees the entire world in the Self, Brahman. The mind is the creator of the universe, and the mind itself is in Atma, the Self. Even so, the mind and all that it creates is in the Self. ‘You are not in delusion. It is the delusion that is in you; all the worlds are in you and you are not in any world; all time is in you and you are not in any time, past, present or future.’ The Jnani has understood the Truth.\nAlso in me:\nFor the sage of steady wisdom, the Self, is the Lord Himself. And so what he sees in his Self, the same is seen in God also.\n‘The Jnani is Myself – says the Lord. There is no difference. This is the Advaitic realisation of the supreme Brahman. In that state, the devotee and God are one, and the disciple and the Guru are one. There is no second thing at all. It is all one indivisible absolute Reality.\nBy seeing all beings in Self and God the sage becomes one with God. It cannot happen that the whole universe can be seen in two separate things. Self and God are one and the same. The man of Self-realisation is God Himself.\nBhagavad Gita 4.35 by Swami Sarvapriyananda\nRelated Articles:\nArjuna said: My delusion is destroyed, I have regained my memory through your grace, ‘O Krishna! I stand firm, free from doubt; I will act according to your word. (\nBG 18.73\n)\nThe sage harmonised in yoga sees the Self in all beings, and all beings in the Self; he sees the same everywhere. (\nBG 6.29\n)\nHe who sees Me in all beings and all beings in me never becomes lost to me, nor do I become lost to him. (\nBG 6.30\n)\nThe Yogi who worships Me abiding in all beings and who is established in unity abides in me in whatever manner he is acting.

    "translation": "Even if you are the most sinful of all sinners you shall cross all sin by the raft of Knowledge.",
    "commentary": "The excellence of Brahmajnana is further declared here. Even the worst sinner can purify himself of all sins by Knowledge. Mountains of sins are burnt into ashes in a trice by a spark of divine wisdom. That is why the Lord gives a highly superlative definition of the sinner. If even the most wicked is able to cross over all sin by the raft of Knowledge, others need not have any doubt about their salvation through knowledge. Enough it is if there is repentance and a determination to sin no more.\nThe verse does not mean that people wilfully commit sins. That is not the import of the Lord’s teaching. In former births, out of ignorance, a man might have committed several kinds of sins, but all of them would be cleared when the light of knowledge dawns. Indeed man’s sins are compared to an ocean and Knowledge is rightly spoken of as the launch to cross the ocean. We have such examples of sinners turned into saints. The life of Valmiki illustrates this point. He lived the life of a dacoit in the beginning, but when wisdom dawned on him the sinner was transformed into a saint.\nBhagavad Gita 4.36 by Swami Sarvapriyananda\nSri Ramakrishna Says —\nA DEVOTEE:\n“Sir, is there no help, then, for such a worldly person?”\nMASTER:\n“Certainly there is. From time to time he should live in the company of holy men, and from time to time go into solitude to meditate on God. Furthermore, he should practise discrimination and pray to God, ‘Give me faith and devotion.’\nOnce a person has faith he has achieved everything. There is nothing greater than faith.\n(To Kedar) “You must have heard about the tremendous power of faith. It is said in the Purana that Rama, who was God Himself — the embodiment of Absolute Brahman — had to build a bridge to cross the sea to Ceylon. But Hanuman, trusting in Rama’s name, cleared the sea in one jump and reached the other side. He had no need of a bridge. (All laugh.) “Once a man was about to cross the sea. Bibhishana wrote Rama’s name on a leaf, tied it in a corner of the man’s wearing-cloth, and said to him: ‘Don’t be afraid. Have faith and walk on the water. But look here — the moment you lose faith you will be drowned.’ The man was walking easily on the water. Suddenly he had an intense desire to see what was tied in his cloth. He opened it and found only a leaf with the name of Rama written on it. ‘What is this?’ he thought. ‘Just the name of Rama!’ As soon as doubt entered his mind he sank under the water.\n“If a man has faith in God, then even if he has committed the most heinous sins — such as killing a cow, a brahmin, or a woman — he will certainly be saved through his faith. Let him only say to God, ‘O Lord,! will not repeat such an action’, and he need not be afraid of anything.”\n(\nBG 10.3\n,\nBG 4.36\n,\nBG 9.32\n,\nBG 18.66\n)\nWhen he had said this, the Master sang:\nIf only I can pass away repeating Durga’s name,\nHow canst Thou then, O Blessed One,\nWithhold from me deliverance,\nWretched though I may be?\nI may have stolen a drink of wine, or killed a child unborn,\nOr slain a woman or a cow,\nOr even caused a brahmin’s death;\nBut, though it all be true,\nNothing of this can make me feel the least uneasiness;\nFor through the power of Thy sweet name\nMy wretched soul may still aspire\nEven to Brahmanhood.

There is a reason for it. Many spiritual feelings have passed through your body; therefore it has fallen ill. At the time an emotion is aroused, one understands very little about it.

The elephant of divine emotion enters the hut of this body and shatters it to pieces.\n“Do you know what actually happens? When a house is on fire, at first a few things inside burn. Then comes the great commotion. Just so, the fire of Knowledge at first destroys such enemies of spiritual life as passion, anger, and so forth. Then comes the turn of ego. And lastly a violent commotion is seen in the physical frame.\n“You may think that everything is going to be over. But God will not release you as long as the slightest trace of your illness is left. You simply cannot leave the hospital if your name is registered there. As long as the illness is not perfectly cured, the doctor won’t give you a permit to go. Why did you register your name in the hospital at all?” (\nAll laugh.\n)\nKeshab laughed again and again at the Master’s allusion to the hospital. Then Sri Ramakrishna spoke of his own illness. (\nTo Keshab)\n-“Hriday used to say, ‘Never before have I seen such ecstasy for God, and never before have I seen such illness.’ I was then seriously ill with stubborn diarrhoea. It was as if millions of ants were gnawing at my brain. But all the same, spiritual talk went on day and night. Dr. Rama of Natagore was called in to see me. He found me discussing spiritual truth. ‘What a madman!’ he said. ‘Nothing is left of him but a few bones, and still he is reasoning like that!'”\nMASTER (\nto Keshab\n):\n“All depends on God’s will.\nO Mother, all is done after Thine own sweet will;\nThou art in truth self-willed, Redeemer of mankind!\nThou workest Thine own work; men only call it theirs. …..\n(Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)",

The impurity caused by ignorance is only cleansed by Knowledge. The physical body needs cleansing with water and soap every day. The subtle body also needs purification. And the purifying agents are Nishkama Karma, meditation, worship of God, and such other practices. Of them all, Knowledge is the best and greatest purifier.\nBy oneself:\nEach individual has to find that Knowledge by himself. One should eat by himself to satisfy his hunger. One should take medicine by himself to cure his own disease. The Master provides all the help needed for the spiritual quest, but finally, each one should realise the Truth himself. There can be no proxy in Jnana. It is a direct personal experience.\nPerfected in Yoga:\nThe man perfected in yoga obtains Knowledge. Nishkama Karma Yoga should become automatic, spontaneous, and natural. Then yoga is said to be perfect. The mind is purified of the taint of Selfishness and attachment to the gross material world. Then the man finds Knowledge.\nIn Self:\nWhere is this Knowledge? Is it in the sky or beyond the clouds? Is it in the other world? Or is it in the centre of the earth? – Where is this Knowledge? It is in the Self. All the time it has been there. Not knowing it man has been seeking it in the outside world, in temples, in rivers and mountains, and so on. After all this long search, man comes back to his own Self, and there he discovers that Knowledge which liberates him from sorrow and delusion. All knowledge, all perfection is already in the Self.\nIn due season:\nThe Lord answers the question when this Knowledge becomes manifest. In due season, this Knowledge which is already in the Self reveals itself, and then the endless wanderings of the mind stop forever. There is no time limit for this supreme revelation. When the mind becomes pure, Knowledge comes of its own accord. Sooner or later this Knowledge should manifest itself, the time taken depending on the ripeness of the individual. No one needs to be discouraged that he has not got it immediately. As he continues the spiritual Sadhana, the mind gradually drops off its taints and blemishes and Truth is seen and known. The plant of spirituality should be watered and taken care of in every way. Sincerity and earnestness are essential. By God’s grace Knowledge is revealed to the aspirant.\nBhagavad Gita 4.38 by Swami Sarvapriyananda\nSwami Vivekananda Says —\nIt has been said that adversity is the touchstone of true knowledge, and this may be said a hundred times with regard to the truth: “Thou art That.” This truly diagnoses the vairagya (dispassion) disease. Blessed is the life of one who has developed this symptom. In spite of your dislike I repeat the old saying: “Wait for a short time.” You are tired with rowing; rest on your oars. The momentum will take the boat to the other side. This has been said in the Gita, “In good time, having reached perfection in yoga, one realizes That in one’s own heart.”\n[Source]",

The sick man should have faith in the physician and the medicine prescribed by him. Otherwise, the efficacy of the medicine is neutralised by the negative attitude of the patient. As the Sadhaka practises the discipline sincerely at first, he would gain some simple spiritual experience, which would confirm his faith in the higher laws of spirituality.\nIt should be understood that Faith is not a denial of one’s reason and judgment. What is implied is that the seeker should carry out the instructions of the Sastras and the Gure in the full hope that they would yield the best results. And when he knows by experience the value of faith, his progress becomes quicker and smoother. So one should have faith in his spiritual destiny.\n(2)\nHaving Knowledge as the supreme goal:\nThe aspirant should have single-minded devotion to the spiritual ideal. There should not be any discordant note in the general harmony of word, thought and deed. One may talk of spirituality and yet his thoughts may be plunged in gross worldliness, and his deeds may be utterly sensual. Such a split personality cannot make any progress in any direction. Divided aims and distracted minds achieve nothing. The personality of man, complete and entire, should be dedicated to the spiritual aim. He should fully realise within himself that there is no other goal to strive for. Naturally, by discrimination, when it is known that all other things are painful perishable worthless stuff, the spiritual aim alone shines as a perfect star. Then Self-realisation becomes possible.\n(3)\nOf controlled senses:\nFaith and single-minded devotion to the divine aim should be accompanied with systematic practice of sense-restraint. Faith and aspiration may do much, but for perfection in Jnana, the senses should be brought under control. So long as the mind runs after material objects through the channels of the senses, wisdom cannot be found. The attempt is to turn the mind inwards. The sense-organs by their very nature function by attaching themselves to some physical object or other. The mind is linked to the senses, and so the mind runs out. This link should be cut, and the mind should be trained to look inward. Then the senses can do nothing. They remain powerless in their places. So sense-control is prescribed as the third characteristic of the man of Knowledge.\nWhat is the fruit of this Knowledge? Peace, Supreme Peace (\nParam santim adhigacchati\n). Swiftly the wise man attains peace. Everyone is seeking peace and happiness. But it is eluding him. He seeks it in worldly pleasures and possessions. But he does not find it in them. So he is restless and distracted. Where is that peace? The Lord answers the question. Peace is in the Knowledge of Atma, and nowhere else. Every little satisfaction which one desires from small pleasures and successes here and there in the world are only shadows of the real peace of the Self. So let all people go to the very source of Peace – Atma. Having thus described the excellence of Jnana, the Lord concludes that it leads to Supreme Peace.\nBhagavad Gita 4.39 by Swami Sarvapriyananda\nSwami Saradananda: “Of the ‘Six treasures’ (viz. calmness of mind, control over the senses, etc.) Shraddhå or unswerving faith is one. What really counts in the spiritual domain is this faith -faith in the words of one’s Guru, in the Lord, in the scriptures. “The Guru has asked me to do such and such a thing, if I act up to his instructions I am sure to attain success, it can never be otherwise.’ Such burning faith in the words of the Guru is what is really required.\n…… “The reality must not be lost sight of. One must have a tight hold over it-the Truth, the only abiding thing in this fleeting world. The Master once told Hari Maharaj (Swami Turiyananda), ‘You are studying Vedanta. What’s the essence of it? Brahman alone is true and the Jagat (the world) is false. Isn’t it? Or anything else? What you require is the essence; throw off everything else.’ The Master first heard what the great saints of different sects and faiths had to teach, then one day he collected a good number of scriptures, made a garland of them and having put it on danced for a while and then tore the books to pieces and threw them off. You get a letter requesting you to send certain things to the writer, when you get the things and send them on, you have no need of the letter. The Truth is what we require – the essence of this universe.” (Source: Spiritual Talks by the First Disciples of Sri Ramakrishna)",

    "translation": "But the ignorant man, the faithless man, the doubting man goes to destruction. For the doubting self, there is no happiness either in this world or the next.",
    "commentary": "While the positive declaration assures salvation to the man of faith, this nagative assertion condemns all those who have neither faith nor knowledge. It is necessary to describe the fate of the unbelievers to re-inforce the positive merits of the faithful.\n(1)\nThe ignorant:\nThe ignorant man knows nothing of the Reality and so he believes that the objective world alone is real, and working for pleasure and fortune in it, he is cast into the ocean of samsara, the cycle of birth and death endlessly.\n(2)\nThe faithless:\nThe faithless man also suffers destruction. The Sastras show the righteous path, the way of Dharma, and the Guru gives instructions about spiritual practices. The seeker should have faith in both. Otherwise, he falls from the way of Dharma, and an unrighteous conduct of life leads to destruction.\n(3)\nThe doubting person:\nThe doubting person knows not what his duty is. He doubts the veracity of the Sastras, the teachings of the Guru, and he has no goal to reach, no clear aim to achieve. Such a man is doomed to destruction. He is a failure in this world. He has no hope of a better world hereafter. He lives and dies unhappy and miserable.\nSo the Lord exhorts the seeker to work with faith, diligence, and determination. He should be filled with self-confidence and perfect faith in the Sastras and the Guru. Such a man attains spiritual progress and realisation.\nBhagavad Gita 4.40 by Swami Sarvapriyananda\nSwami Vivekananda Says —\nLikewise the education that our boys receive is very negative. The schoolboy learns nothing, but has everything of his own broken down — want of shraddha is the result. The shraddha which is the keynote of the Veda and the Vedanta — the shraddha which emboldened Nachiketa to face Yama and question him, through which shraddha this world moves — the annihilation of that shraddha! “The ignorant, the man devoid of shraddha, the doubting self runs to ruin.” Therefore are we so near to destruction. The remedy now is the spread of education.\n[Source]\nSri Ramakrishna Says —\nSri Ramakrishna, who could read a man’s inmost thought, said: “One doesn’t lose consciousness by thinking of Him who is all Spirit, all Consciousness. Shivanath once remarked that too much thinking about God confounds the brain. Thereupon I said to him, ‘How can one become unconscious by thinking of Consciousness?'”\nM:\n“Yes, sir, I realise that. It isn’t like thinking of an unreal object. How can a man lose his intelligence if he always fixes his mind on Him whose very nature is eternal Intelligence?”\nMASTER (\nwith pleasure\n):\n“\nIt is through God’s grace that you understand that. The doubts of the mind will not disappear without His grace. Doubts do not disappear without Self-realisation.\n“But one need not fear anything if one has received the grace of God. It is rather easy for a child to stumble if he holds his father’s hand; but there can be no such fear if the father holds the child’s hand.\nA man does not have to suffer any more if God, in His grace, removes his doubts and reveals Himself to him. But this grace descends upon him only after he has prayed to God with intense yearning of heart and practised spiritual discipline.\nThe mother feels compassion for her child when she sees him running about breathlessly. She has been hiding herself; now she appears before the child.”\n“\nBut why should God make us run about?\n” thought M.\nImmediately Sri Ramakrishna said: “It is His will that we should run about a little. Then it is great fun. God has created the world in play, as it were. This is called Mahamaya, the Great Illusion. Therefore one must take refuge in the Divine Mother, the Cosmic Power Itself. It is She who has bound us with the shackles of illusion. The realisation of God is possible only when those shackles are severed.” (Source:\nGospel of Sri Ramakrishna\n)",

    "commentary": "It is evident that the man who has no longing for the fruits of action, who has surrendered them to the Lord, is not bound by the wheel of Karma. He has no attachment to the body and so he has no sense of doership. He is established in Atma, and looks upon the world as an illusion and a dream. Hence actions do not bind him. He may be continuously working, and yet he is not in action as he has no feeling of attachment and doership. The fire of Knowledge burns up all actions, as it has been already declared.\nOne whose doubts are cleared by practical Knowledge:\nTill the aspirant reaches the ultimate Truth doubts will crop up in some form or other. Only when Truth is seen, all doubts are cleared.\nOne who is established in Atma:\nIt has already been declared that the seeker should be firmly established in the Self to attain complete freedom. He who has the knowledge of the Self alone removes the last trace of the bondage of Karma. All others are bound to reap the fruit of their actions in an endless series of births.\nBhagavad Gita 4.41 by Swami Sarvapriyananda",

    "commentary": "Thus the Lord, having taught the secret of the Supreme Self, and by that Knowledge, the ability to perform Nishkama Karma, finally exhorts Arjuna to stand up and fight the battle. It should be noted that Jnana enables man to discharge his duties under all circumstances with a clear vision of the true nature of action, and his own immovable station is the Self. This Discourse is entitled Jnana Yoga and the last words of the Lord are “Stand up O Arjuna!” Arjuna was sunk in despair and doubt, and now knowing the Truth about the real Self, he should stand up and fight the battle as it is the duty prescribed for him in the present situation.\nBorn of ignorance:\nAll doubts and delusions have their origin in ignorance. The moment Knowledge dawns, they are all cleared as the mist is cleared by the sun.\nIn the heart:\nIgnorance is lodged in the heart from the beginning of time. But all that darkness is cleared when the lamp of Knowledge is lit (i.e.) when the real Self is perceived.\nWith the sword of knowledge:\nIgnorance cannot be destroyed by anything except Jnana. So Jnana is compared to a sword that cuts the knot of ignorance and releases man from the bondage of Karma forever.\nPerform Nishkama Karma:\nHaving attained Knowledge, what should man do? This question is answered here. Does the Jnani sit in a corner and idle away the time? No. He works, works for the good of humanity. He has nothing to gain by such work. It is all done to lift mankind from the mire of delusion, to spread the glorious message of spirituality, to kindle the fire of Atmajnana in others, to purify and enable man, to enable him to see the glory of his real Self. Sankara, Buddha, Jesus and other sages have done tremendous work for the good of mankind. Many wise men even today are performing such selfless work.",
