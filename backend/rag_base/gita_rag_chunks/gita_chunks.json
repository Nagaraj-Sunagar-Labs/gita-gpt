    "text": "Dhrishtadyumna, the son of King Drupada was the commander of the Pandava army. He arranged the army in a special formation known as Vajra Vyuha in the science of war. Duryodhana might have approached Dronacharya for the purpose of asking him to arrange his own army in a more powerful formation. Duryodhana was a king possessing overall command of the entire army. Drona was one of the commanders. How does it happen that the king, instead of asking the commander to meet him, should himself approach him personally? This doubt may be cleared by considering the following points. 1. Duryodhana might have been struck with fear when he saw the enemy-army and heroes like Bhima and Arjuna. Fear, of course, is not an auspicious sign. 2. Drona was a commander and should have been at the post of duty from whence he should not be disturbed at that time. 3. Drona was a teacher, learned and old, and it was the duty of Duryodhana to show him respect. 4. The purpose of Duryodhana was to win the favour of Drona for achieving his own selfish object of winning the war against his cousins, who were also the disciples of Drona.",

Duryodhana never had any qualms of conscience, nor any feeling of pity for those who would be destroyed on both sides, nor the supreme question of what is Dharma under these circumstances, nor any reconsideration of his attitude which would naturally arise in the heart of an evolved being. Arjuna was far superior to Duryodhana as a man, and so his reaction was entirely different, and the divine message of the Gita was offered to him.",

According to common usage, it should be mentioned here as Duryodhana Uvacha.’ But Veda Vyasa does not give him the privilege of naming him as the speaker because he is evil-minded. Duryodhana is deeply skilled in diplomacy. He tries to curry the favour of Drona by personally approaching him. Not only that, he tries to rouse Drona’s passions of anger and hatred by referring to Drishtadyumna as the son of King Drupada. Duryodhana knows how Drupada insulted Drona and how Drona avenged the insult by humiliating the king with the help of Arjuna, and how later, Drupada, in a vengeful spirit, obtained through holy sacrifice a son who would cause the death of Drona, and that son was no other than the present commander of the Pandava Army. Duryodhana tries to fan into flame the ancient hatred between Drona and Drupada. His purpose is evidently to rouse the combative spirit of his Master by speaking highly about the enemy-formation under the leadership of his disciple Drishtadyumna is spoken of as ‘ dhimata ‘ – well-versed in the art of war. So it is that the Pandavas chose him as the Commander",

He means of course that all the warriors on his side are determined to fight to the last, to lay down their lives for his sake.

Duryodhana might have referred thus just because he was directly speaking to Drona or because it should be proper to refer to his teacher first, or because it would inspire Drona to do his best in the battle. Though Drona knew the chief heroes on either side, Duryodhana, on the pretext of reminding him, enumerates them again, and calculated the difference in strength between the two armies. He means of course that all the warriors on his side are determined to fight to the last, to lay down their lives for his sake. But by a stroke of tragic irony, it is indicative of their destruction in battle. Some commentators hold the view that it is an ill-omen for Duryodhana.",

    "text": "There is a difference of view among the commentators about the meaning of the words aparyaptam and paryaptam . Anandagiri, Sankarananda and others give the meaning ‘limitless’ to the word aparyaptam , Sridhara and others give the opposite meaning ‘limited’. But it appears that the first meaning is more appropriate to the context, and is consistent with the earlier estimate given by Duryodhana. In the Udyoga Parva (54, 60, 70) and in the Bhishma Parva (51-4-6) Duryodhana, speaking to his father and Drona respectively glorifies the strength of his own army. There is every reason why he should speak well of his own army in the present situation, when they are about to fight the battle. It should also be remembered that in the Bhishma Parva speaking to Drona, Duryodhana utters exactly the same verse while estimating the superior power of his own army Well-protected by Bhima – Why should Duryodhana refer to the Pandava army as well-protected by Bhima, when Dhristadyumna is the actual commander? The following reasons may be considered. 1. Duryodhana naturally thinks of Bhima as the most deadly enemy to himself and to his brothers 2. Though Dhristadyumna is the commander, Bhima was entrusted with the",

So, if the Pandavas should place Sikhandi at the foremost point of their army, Bhishma would not face it, and so his power would be partially neutralised. Taking advantage of it, the enemies might injure and kill him. Duryodhana knew the secret. So he directs all the leaders of his army to see that Sikhandi is kept out of the way, so that Bhishma would be free to fight at his best. If Bhishma was safe, he would be able to make the most powerful onslaught on the enemy, and be the bulwark of defense for the entire Kaurava army. Knowing this he directed all to protect Bhishma in all possible ways.",

Therefore the epithet ‘durbuddhi’ is indicative of the impending destruction of Duryodhana. It is a warning to all those whose mental disposition is darkened by evil propensities, that, like Duryodhana, they would ruin themselves by defeat, disgrace and death. Let everybody therefore strive for purity of mind and heart for spiritual progress. Wishing to please: All those who sided Duryodhana perished.

Never before in his life did he do so on any battle-field in any situation. So there should be a powerful cause for the present problem of Arjuna. This cause is easily discernable from his own words. It is nothing but the deeply planted feeling of attachment for his relations and friends, and the awful contemplation of slaying them in the battle. He speaks repeatedly of ‘ svajanam ‘ (our people). His distress for the destruction of his own people touches his very heart and throws the whole man off his balance. As a result, he decides to give up every thing-kingdom, pleasures, and enjoyments, even dominion over the three worlds. Lord Krishna seizes this opportune moment when Arjuna’s mind was filled with the thought of absolute renunciation and teaches the highest Brahmavidya. Hence Arjuna’s despondency is transformed into a Yoga. Arjuna yearned to know what was Dharma, having given up all dominion, pleasures and enjoyment. Hence it is Yoga. Such deep renunciation is essential for all seekers after truth. It ultimately leads to righteousness and union",

There is only one thought for the prisoner, and that is to regain his freedom and to see the light. So feels the ignorant man, when he is burdened with the weight of sorrow. Such is the experience of Arjuna. It is the first and the foremost qualification for receiving the highest knowledge. One who does not possess this intense dispassion cannot receive the supreme knowledge. Even if it is taught to him, he cannot understand it. It is wasted in the same way as one attempts to dye a dirty piece of cloth. Thus we come to know that Arjuna qualified himself for supreme wisdom by his intense dispassion in the present situation.

We should note that it was not just Arjuna’s voice that became silent. His mind, though not totally silent, became calmer than what it was in the last verse. Otherwise, it could not have assimilated the teaching that was about to follow. Also note that the narration has shifted back to Sanjaya in this verse, and the meter has changed back to normal.

Arjuna was caught in the grip of sorrow, as he did not understand the hidden laws of Dharma. Lord Krishna was the very embodiment of knowledge and Dharma. Therefore the specious arguments of Arjuna, the spurious feelings of pity and compassion, the mental distraction, and physical collapse of Arjuna, raised a smile on the lips of the Lord.

Just as the whole tree is involved in the seed, the whole of the `Gita Sastra’ is implied in this Sloka. The message of the Gita starts with the word ‘Asochyan’ and ends with the words ‘ma suchah’ (do not grieve). So it appears that the main purpose of the Gita teaching is “the removal of sorrow.” Those who should not be grieved for: Every object in the world has five aspects: (1) existence, (2) light, (3) joy, (4) name, and (5) form. Of these, the first three -existence, light, and joy (sat, chit, ananda) are real and eternal. The later two, name and form (nama and rupa) are unreal and transitory. The first three constitute the real nature of man, and not name and form. But such is the power of ignorance (`avidya’) that man sees, knows and clings to the later two only – namely name and form. The first three are not directly seen, though they are experienced every moment of life. Thus, if we",

Therefore, since the real man is eternal, one need not weep and wail for the modifications of name and form which he observes in life and death. When the real man is deathless, for whom should we grieve, and for what? That is the Lord’s position. Words of wisdom: Intellectual arguments are conceived by Buddhi, by which power man comes to decisions after due consideration. But the intellect is finite. It operates within a limited range. It cannot go beyond the Buddhi. Buddhi and the intellect are parts of nature, and they are subject to errors and mistakes in their concepts and conclusions. But it is different with men who have crossed the border land of the intellect and entered the realm of Atma – the superconscious state. He alone knows and speaks the truth. Arjuna did not attain that state. So he measures every thing with the yardstick of his own deluded intellect. His arguments not to fight the battle are of this nature. Lord Krishna dismisses",

He has become like an animal, like a baby, just letting his heart carry away his brain, making a fool of himself and trying to cover his weakness with the flowery names of “love” and so on. Krishna sees through that. Arjuna talks like a man of little learning and brings out many reasons, but at the same time he talks the language of a fool. “The sage is not sorry for those that are living nor for those that die.” [Source] Even forgiveness, if weak and passive, is not true: fight is better.

He picked up a flower and touched with it first his head, then his throat, heart, and navel. To the devotees he seemed a child playing with flowers.

But those who know that these modifications belong to the realm of the body only and that the Self remains untroubled and uncontaminated by them, are free from pleasure and pain, and such men live always in a state of happiness. However, so long as man is in the embodied state, even the Jnani must go through the physical changes. But since he knows the sharp distinction between the body and Atma, his attitude to them is entirely different from that of the ignorant man. So the Lord’s command is ‘endure them’. (`Titikshasva’). There is no other way. Producers of pleasure and pain: The pleasure experienced by the senses is not pure pleasure. It is mixed with pain. If it is a pure pleasure, it should not have any touch of pain either -before or afterward. Elsewhere in the Gita, it is said that the pleasures derived through contact of the senses with worldly objects are",

There can be no such thing as pleasure apart from pain. They are the two sides of the same coin. They are called `dvandvas’ – pairs of opposites, which always go together. So the Lord speaks of them together as producers of pleasure and pain (sukhadukhadah). With beginning and end: When worldly pleasures come no one need be elated, for their nature is not simply to appear but to disappear also, and where there is elation there should be depression. Pleasures come as guests and again depart. They are transitory and short-lived. Therefore one should not get himself attached to them. Such attachment will always lead to pain when they disappear, and it is absolutely certain that they disappear in course of time. He is then the ‘dhira’- the man of courage, who is disinterested in them and feels no attraction for them.

There is always the knowledge that fresh leaves come up with the arrival of spring. The whole of Nature presents such alternate pictures of bareness and beauty according to the changes of seasons.

Having entered time and space, the Self remains still above and beyond them. Every object in time is subject to time. There is no object which is not finally destroyed by time. Worlds, stars, constellations, all things seen and known are swallowed up by time. And what is most wonderful is that the Self swallows up time and remains as Self. It is known as `antakantaka’.

When the mind is purified, it merges in the Atma and disappears, and when the mind disappears the whole of the objective world disappears, and only Atma remains in its own state. How then can the mind understand Atma? Moreover, every object in the world goes through six processes of change -birth, growth, etc. Atma is not born, is not subject to death, is changeless and eternal. It is the eternal subject, the seer, It is the eternal witness of the universe. It is the very essence of Existence, Knowledge, and Bliss. It is the final cause of the Universe. Ultimately the Universe dissolves into Atma and it alone remains without a second.

And they cease all contact with the body after death. Only for a brief interval in the middle period, there is a kind of link. What has not existed in the beginning and what does not exist after the end, though it appears in between the two points, cannot be real. It is non-existence. The whole universe is thus an illusion. This is the drumbeat of Vedanta. The dream world did not exist before the dream. It does not exist after one wakes up from the dream. It exists only while the dream lasts.

The true warrior is always eager to undertake a righteous war. The spiritual seeker is always ready and alert to fight ignorance in whatever form it may raise its head. The righteous war is not a religious war against the followers of other religions. The righteous war may be waged even against our own evil-doer kith and kin (Rig Veda 6.75.19).

Just as the warrior obtains Heaven if killed, or enjoys the pleasures of the world if victorious, the spiritual aspirant would attain the highest Moksha if successful, and if not successful, he would ascend to higher realms of existence. The spiritual aspirant is constantly at war with Avidya, ignorance. But there is no fear for him, successful or otherwise. In both ways, a new vista of joy and glory is open to him. In the 6th Chapter, the Lord refers to the future of an aspirant whose body falls before the completion of his Sadhana.

Thus he would be free from the disturbing emotions of pride, egotism, and elation in success, self-pity in sorrow, and despair in failure. Some people think that the yoga of work is a lower path and that work binds man to the wheel of birth and death. If a man attaches himself to the fruits of work, then he is bound and he has to take a number of births to enjoy or suffer the effect of his works. On the other hand, if the aspirant knows that he has nothing to seek for in the universe, that he is Atma, then he is indifferent to the results of his work. This is the secret of Karma Yoga. Perfect knowledge should illumine work. Therefore the Lord first teaches Arjuna in the second discourse (Sankhya Yoga) the highest doctrine of Vedanta (i.e), the indivisibility of the personal man with Paramatma, the immortality of the self, and then, comes down to teach the method of work. Truth will preach itself, it will not die for the want of the helping hands of me!",

    "text": "This is the starting verse of the theory of Karma Yoga, the main theme of the Gita. In this verse, the Lord teaches the secret of Karma Yoga. Though engaged in various types of activity, a man can live without any taint of sin. That secret lies in the balance of mind, equanimity, and detachment. Man should work without losing his equanimity in the vicissitudes of natural change. Success unbalances the mind by a wave of elation, and defeat by a wave of depression. This is what the common man experiences in the course of his life’s activity. The Gita propounds equanimity, as the only cure for these mental waves carrying man from one extreme to another. And these mental disturbances are caused by attachment to the enjoyments of life. The seeker should know that he has nothing to gain or lose by victory or defeat in his endeavors. Thus he would be free from the disturbing emotions of pride, egotism, and elation in success, self-pity in sorrow, and despair in failure. When the mind is kept in a state of equanimity, Atma is reflected clearly. How can such a man incur sin? Some people think that the yoga of",

Though the man is engaged in a hundred tasks, yet the main affirmation of the mind is only one (i.e.) the universality of the Supreme Self. So in all that he does, his mind is firmly fixed in Atma. He sees the same Atma, in all that he does. This is faith. He surrenders the fruits of his work to God. He has no desire to enjoy anything of the fruits of his work. Those who have not cultivated this single-minded faith, attach their minds to various objects of the world, enjoy them in various ways, and go on hopping from one thing to another just as birds hop from one branch to another in search of leaf or fruit. They have no concentration of mind because they have no faith. The different rays of the sun passing through a concave lens become one, and the heat produced by it is capable of burning up anything.

Atma, which is the seer of all objective phenomena is not conditioned by the gunas. It is beyond them. It is eternally perfect.

As these later two are slowly eliminated, pure satva (sudha satva) alone remains, when the sadhaka experiences the bliss of Atma. But in the final state of realisation, even this is transcended, and Atma alone, unconditioned and attributeless, remains in its own purity and perfection. The mind which has acquired the power to contemplate the Infinite Atma is called Satva. So says Sage Vasishta. Since it is enjoined, nityasatvasthah, it is imperative that the seeker should hold on to that state always. Having nothing to gain or retain in the world:- Yoga means the requisition of new things. Kshema means the preservation of the things required. The whole world is engaged in these two things, acquisition and preservation. Wealth, name, position, power, health, children, etc., are the things that man is constantly trying to acquire, and preserving them after they are acquired.

So the way to transcend the gunas is to hold on to the Atmic state, with perseverance and determination. Swami Vivekananda Says — “The Vedas only teach things belonging to the three gunas, to sattva, rajas, and tamas.” The Vedas only teach about things in nature. People cannot think anything they do not see on earth. If they talk about heaven, they think of a king sitting on a throne, of people burning incense. It is all nature, nothing beyond nature. The Vedas, therefore, teach nothing but nature. “Go beyond nature, beyond the dualities of existence, beyond your own consciousness, caring for nothing, neither for good nor for evil.” [Source] “Go thou beyond the scriptures, because they teach only up to nature, up to the three qualities.” When we go beyond them, we find the harmony, and not before.

    "text": "You have the right to work only, and not to the fruits of work. Let not the fruit of action be your motive, nor let your attachment be to inaction. The doctrine of Karma Yoga is declared in this verse. It means that work should be done in a spirit of surrendering the fruits to the Lord. At all times, and under all circumstances, man should keep the mind free from the desire for the fruits of work. Thus, we see that work prompted by desire is a disturbing and not a purifying factor in spiritual sadhana. Unless the mind is purified, man cannot get a glimpse of the Self. Therefore nishkama karma is absolutely essential for spiritual realisation. The Lord’s command is a hammer blow on all forms of idleness and weakness, which apparently looks like the peace of Jnana. Some people, out of ignorance, spend their time in empty nothingness, imagining that state to be Brahmanishta. This verse means that we should not expect only favorable results of our choices and should accept all results as Prasada (Grace) from God. This is called Prasada Buddhi, BuddhiYoga, KarmaYoga and surrendering to His Will. One is given the power and the ability to do one’s respective duty in life, but one is not free to choose the desired results. Swami Karmananda says: The essence of KarmaYoga is to go to work just to please the creator; mentally re­nounce the fruits of all action; and let God take care of the results. Therefore, duty should be performed with detached attach­ment. A person should work without any mo­tive as a matter of duty for a greater cause of helping human­ity rather than just helping oneself, one’s children, or a few individuals. Equanimity and spiri­tual progress result from selfless service, whereas work with selfish motives create the bonds of Karma as well as great disappointments. Dharma and selfishness cannot stay together. One who knows the Truth does not let the shadow of personal gain fall on the path of duty. “To work you have the right, but not to the fruits thereof.” Man can train himself to know and to practise that, says the karma-yogi. Let us do good because it is good to do good; he who does good work even in order to get to heaven binds himself down, says the karma-yogi. Therefore Krishna shows us the lower ways and methods. Even good deeds can find a man in great bondage. Therefore be not bound by good deeds or by desire for name and fame. They have been true followers of the Gita; they practically carried out the great mandate, “To work you have the right, but not to the fruits thereof.” [Source] By the by, I have made a discovery as to the mental method of really practising what the Gita teaches, of working without an eye to results. [Source] Though the ideal of work of our Brahmavadin should always be “कर्मण्येवाधिकारस्ते मा फलेषु कदाचन — To work thou hast the right, but never to the fruits thereof”, yet no sincere worker passes out of the field of activity without making himself known and catching at least a few rays of light.

When the young fledgling learns to pick its own food, its mother pecks it if it comes to her for food.” M: “ How long must one do one’s duty? The impurity of the mind is destroyed through the performance of duty.

The Lord’s command is that attachment to the fruits of work should be given up, and not the works. To give up work is a sign of laziness and inaction. It is tamas. It is the negation of spiritual progress. In sleep one does not do anything at all. But sleep is not self-realisation. The walls and polls do not work. They are not philosophers for that reason. Therefore inaction born of tamas should be counteracted in every possible way. The Lord’s command is a hammer blow on all forms of idleness and weakness, which apparently looks like the peace of Jnana. Some people, out of ignorance, spend their time in empty nothingness, imagining that state to be Brahmanishta. Such people fail both in material and spiritual life.

This is the message which roused Arjuna to the level of heroic action from his present state of despair and delusion. This key verse of the Gita has confused some commentators and common people who interpret it to mean that one should work without expecting a fruit. This would mean that Lord Krishna should not expect Arjuna to understand and follow His teachings! No one can perform action without expecting some result. This verse means that we should not expect only favorable results of our choices and should accept all results as Prasada (Grace) from God. This is called Prasada Buddhi, BuddhiYoga, KarmaYoga and surrendering to His Will. (See also 18.66 ). The right outlook on life develops when we fully understand that we have the ability to put our best effort into all endeavors, but we cannot pick the results of our work.

Swami Karmananda says: The essence of KarmaYoga is to go to work just to please the creator; mentally re­nounce the fruits of all action; and let God take care of the results. Do your duty in life—to the best of your ability—as God’s personal ser­vant without any regard for the personal enjoyment of the fruits of your work. Fear of failure, caused by being emotionally attached to the fruits of work, is the greatest impediment to success be­cause it robs efficiency by constantly disturbing equanimity of mind. Therefore, duty should be performed with detached attach­ment. Success in any undertaking becomes easier if one works hard without being bothered by the outcome. Work is done more efficiently when the mind is not bothered continuously—consciously or subconsciously—with the outcome, good or bad, of an action. Stress is produced when fruit or goal becomes more important than the work itself",

There are people who eat the prickly leaves of the pineapple and not the fruit.” DEVOTEE: “Sir, why has God put us in the world?” MASTER: “The world is the field of action. Through action one acquires knowledge. The guru instructs the disciple to perform certain works and refrain from others. Again, he advises the pupil to perform action without desiring the result.

Godliness and spirituality should permeate the mind. One should feel his identity with the universal Being. Otherwise, the work he does will bind him to the world.

The man who has properly understood the bondage arising from work done with desire and attachment, and the great good arising from doing work without attachment and desire, is alone fit to ascend to the abode of peace and blessedness beyond all evil and sorrow. When the mind is purified by nishkama karma , knowledge of Atma dawns, by which man is permanently released from the cycle of birth and death, caused by Karma. So we understand how Karma Yoga leads to final liberation. Some people may doubt how Karma could lead to liberation. He affirms that the man who practices nishkama karma will certainly attain the pure sorrowless state of absolute freedom (i.e.) Moksha. If you desire freedom from the bondage of samsara, if you seek for the joy and blessedness of spiritual life, do all your duties whatever they are without attachment for the fruits thereof. Then the knowledge of Atma dawns of its own accord. They are of little use unless the man is capable of discriminating the real from the unreal, and rejecting the unreal through ‘Buddhi Yoga’. There is only one state, one position, where there is not the least touch of pain or sorrow, where it is all an ocean of supreme bliss, and that position is the Atma State, the domain of Brahma Jnana. Do your duty without attachment and desire for the fruits thereof. That is the secret of Karma Yoga and its consummation is Brahmajnana.",

    "text": "Manisha means knowledge. He who possesses discrimination and true knowledge has no concern or use for the fruits of work. It follows that discrimination is necessary to understand the principle of right action. The man who has properly understood the bondage arising from work done with desire and attachment, and the great good arising from doing work without attachment and desire, is alone fit to ascend to the abode of peace and blessedness beyond all evil and sorrow. And through discrimination alone can man work without attachment. When the mind is purified by nishkama karma , knowledge of Atma dawns, by which man is permanently released from the cycle of birth and death, caused by Karma. So we understand how Karma Yoga leads to final liberation. Some people may doubt how Karma could lead to liberation. The Lord clears this doubt here. He affirms that the man who practices nishkama karma will certainly attain the pure sorrowless state of absolute freedom (i.e.) Moksha. Released from the bonds of birth and death: Every thoughtful human being is instinctively seeking freedom from the ills of life. The Lord here points out the easiest path. He is addressing all mankind. “O ye bound",

If you desire freedom from the bondage of samsara, if you seek for the joy and blessedness of spiritual life, do all your duties whatever they are without attachment for the fruits thereof. Surrender them to the Supreme Lord. Your mind will then become pure. Then the knowledge of Atma dawns of its own accord. The moment you experience the Atmic state, you become free and free forever.” Whether a person is free from attachment or not is the real test of wisdom. Scholarship, power of speech, expounding the vedic texts – these are for the delight of the learned only. They are of little use unless the man is capable of discriminating the real from the unreal, and rejecting the unreal through ‘Buddhi Yoga’. Go to the abode free from sorrow: People speak of many positions in the world. They say that an emperor holds a high position. They say that Indra is the Lord of Heaven. Though they are in very high positions still the occupants are caught in the wheel of samsara . They have birth and death, joy and sorrow pleasure and pain. There is only one state, one position, where there is not the",

At that time the aspirant no longer needs anyone else to resolve doubts and problems regarding spiritual matters.

Referring to this state, the Master said: “Finally, the mind becomes the guru or acts as a guru. The human guru imparts the mantra to the ear, and the divine guru transmits the mantra to the soul.” But there is a gulf of difference between that exalted mind and this ordinary mind.

The auspicious moment of liberation from the ills of life is in the hands of each individual. When you have acquired faith in the eternal Self, and when you carry out the precepts of spiritual discipline when the mind is brought to a state of equanimity, and when it is fixed steadily in Atma, that very moment man is liberated and he becomes a jivanmukta. The Sastras and the holy men point the way, and the seeker has to realise the truth by his own self-effort. Desires should be given up. The Lord uses a strong term Prajahati instead of jahati , implying thereby that desires should be given up thoroughly, and again, not simply some desires but all desires, without leaving the least residue in the innermost recesses of the mind. Even if the smallest seed of desire is left in the pit of the mind, it sprouts and grows unconsciously, and there is always the danger of the seeker being driven out of the self-state and once again plunged in the mire of delusion. All desires should be given up totally for all time. The lamp of discrimination should be lighted, and there should be a thorough search of the vast dark region to find out the last and least living desire and burn it up into ashes. Just as all the small pebbles in grain are sifted and thrown off before food is prepared, just as all the weeds are cleared off when the garden plants are grown, just as all worms, germs, and pests are removed from vegetable plants, even so, all the desires should be carefully searched for and rejected by the seeker. Therefore the Lord here insists on complete renunciation of all desires forever. Towards this final renunciation, inquiry into the Self, discrimination of the real and the unreal, surrender to the Lord, company of holy men, and such other practices should be undertaken by the aspirant. The Lord immediately explains what happens when the mind is purified of all desire-breeding impressions. Satisfied with his mind fixed in Atma: This is the consummation of all spiritual practices to be perfectly satisfied in the Self by the self. When all the desires are cast off, the mind remains quiet in Atma – the very source of all bliss. The search is carried and birth after birth, till man tired and exhausted by his pursuit of the hare’s horn, may be out of sheer despair, turns inwards into his own Self, and Lo ! Now, the man of discrimination clears up the dust and garbage from his mind and finds that the happiness which he has been seeking from everywhere in the world, is in his own Self. So also, when the impurity of mind in the form of desire is taken away, the seer Atma reveals himself as the pure and perfect Self of man. The practice is the renunciation of desire, and the goal is the experience of Atma. PUNDIT ( quoting from the Gita ): “‘With the heart concentrated by yoga, with the eye of evenness for all things, he beholds the Self in all beings and all beings in the Self.'” MASTER: “Have you read the Adhyatma Ramayana ? “But you must remember one thing: God is very far away from the mind tainted with worldliness.” (Source: Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna ) According to Sri Sarada Devi, desires for knowledge, devotion, and salvation cannot be classed as desires because they are higher desires. One should first replace the lower desires with higher desires and then renounce the highest desires also and be­come absolutely free.",

Desires lie concealed in the unseen nooks and corners of the mind. They survive in the seed form of mental impressions. Whenever they come into contact with the objects of the material world through the senses, they spring up with subtle and irresistible force and cause samsara.

So the first outstanding quality of the sthitaprajna is untainted and perfect bliss. This is his badge, his flag, the banner of his achievement. He is distinguished from others by this characteristic feature. When we find the ignorant people plunged in fear and sorrow, distracted and restless, he alone remains free and blissful in the midst of the ever-changing spectacle of human life.

In the same way, pain and pleasure are the natural reactions of the mind to external phenomenon, and Atma being above the mind (i.e.) transcending the mind, is not affected by its modifications. It remains as the witness of the mind, in the same way, as the Sun is just the witness of what is happening in the lower region of the earth. Vasishta explains to Sri Rama that just as arrows cannot powder a mountain, just as the sea-waves cannot move the mountain on the shore, just as the lotus creeper cannot bind an elephant, even so the sorrows and troubles of the world cannot affect the Jivanmukta, the sthitaprajna.

The Jivanmukta has found himself one with the ocean of bliss, and as such how can he think of attaching himself to any kind of material pleasure? He knows that these little pleasures are only ripples on the surface of the ocean of bliss and that they are shadowy reflections of his own Self.

    "text": "In the Gita, we find that the Lord uses the general term yah (anybody) without limiting its scope to any caste or creed, race, or nationality. Anyone who has acquired firmness in the wisdom of the Self is declared to be a Sthitaprajna whoever he is and whatever may be his caste or creed. This is the sign of the universality of the Gita. Without attachment in all things: One should be detached from and indifferent to everything in the world. Of course, no one is attached to unpleasant things. A similar attitude is to be cultivated towards pleasant things also. Things pleasant and unpleasant are both in the domain of Maya, and the Self is beyond Maya, and so these lower modifications do not in any way affect the Self. The sthitaprajna having reached the Self-state is not at all concerned with them. The man of wisdom does not seek anything. And yet, nature brings many things to him, both pleasant and unpleasant in the course of his life. But he neither rejoices nor laments when these things happen of their own accord. He remains immovable like a mountain in a state of perfect equanimity. This is the mark",

    "text": "of sthitaprajna. It should be understood that the Lord is not advocating a cowardly spirit desisting from the battlefield of life with all its duties, obligations, and responsibilities. Detachment is not neglect of duty. In fact, Arjuna was confused at first when he thought that he could attain peace by running away from the battlefield and taking up the life of a mendicant. The whole of the Gita is intended to emphasize that the challenge of life should be met with courage, equanimity, and knowledge of the real Self. Frustration may put on the garb of detachment. Cowardice may shine under the mask of renunciation. These are the common delusions of a weak mind. The Lord here insists that the good and the bad should be met without elation or depression. The sthitaprajna knows how to live life under all circumstances with mental equipoise and the joy of wisdom. True spiritualists have a peaceful and happy look on their faces under all circumstances. “Who Can Insult Me?” – Swami Saradananda Although the Ramakrishna Order has never involved itself in politics, the presence of the former revolutionaries brought police surveillance upon the Order.

When the senses are drawn back from contact with the sense – objects like sound, color, etc., then the intellect is rooted in Atma. The same truth is stated by Patanjali in the sutras Yogaschittavrittinirodhah, tadadrashtuh svarupe Avasthanum . These two sutras are affirmed by the verse. It means that the senses, which by their nature run after worldly objects should be drawn back, and the mind should be centered in Atma. When this is done firmly, and when there is no deviation from the Self, one’s knowledge becomes perfect. This idea is very clearly brought out by means of an illustration. The tortoise withdraws all its limbs into its own shell at the slightest apprehension of danger from outside. Even if the shell is hacked to pieces it would not extend its limbs. The yogi, like the tortoise, should drawback his senses from the objective world, and settle himself in the Self. It is not enough to restrain one of the senses from one set of objects. Of course, if one sense is controlled, it will make the control of the others easy. The yogi should withdraw all the senses",

Even if one window is kept open, a gust of wind from it may extinguish the lamp. So it is absolutely necessary that all the senses should be turned back, and there should be no contact with the external world. It is the sense-organs that make the person aware of the outside world. When they are drawn back there is no external world. In deep sleep, there is no external world because the senses are not functioning. Similarly, the yogi should stop the operation of the senses in his fully conscious state, and then the mind sees the Self within.

Nothing can shake him, no temptation or anything. Let the universe tumble about him, it does not make one single ripple in his mind. [Source] As the tortoise tucks its feet and head inside the shell, and you may kill it and break it in pieces, and yet it will not come out, even so the character of that man who has control over his motives and organs is unchangeably established. He controls his own inner forces, and nothing can draw them out against his will.

To deny them this form of food means restraining the senses and preventing them from contacting the objective world. But this does not solve the problem. The taste for the objects would still be there in the mind; whenever the opportunity arises, the mental tendencies spring forth to grasp the illusory pleasures because their taste is not dead.

So sense-pleasures of any kind will lead to a downright fall from the spiritual aim. This is emphasized again and again by the Lord. That is why the word Sarvani (all) is used frequently verse after verse. In this verse, two practices are mentioned : (1) Control of the senses from running out and attaching themselves to sense objects, and (2) directing the mind towards the Supreme Lord (merging in Atma). It means rejection of the objective world (Drisya) and identification with the subject (Drik). Both practices are necessary. The first practice alone is not enough. In sleep, the senses do not function, and the objective world is not there. And yet there is no knowledge. So identification with the subject (Drik) is essential while rejecting the objective world (Drishya). It is not enough to clear debts; one should acquire some property. Then he is satisfied. Similarly let a man ceaselessly reject the sense-world as it appears and at the same time, let him think of himself as the pure and perfect Atma. Again, the second practice meditating on",

Similarly, when attraction and repulsion (Raga and Dwesha) are eliminated from the mind, the senses lose their evil power, and then they are only instruments in the hands of man to do what he wants them to do, or to remain quiet in their places. Such a man can move freely in the world and no harm comes to him. When the horses are well under control, the charioteer feels free and happy because they take him easily to the destination without trouble and danger. So the senses help and not hinder the man who has obtained control over the mind. Self-restrained, self-controlled: Self-control is the necessary condition for Self-realisation.

That is the unfortunate state of man. From all these evils man is protected by the contemplation of the Self and when peace is attained, these are completely eliminated. Peace is the condition of Moksha. If peace does not fill the whole being of man, Moksha remains only in intellectual concept without real meaning or substance in it. Mind is firmly fixed in Atma: When the mind is untroubled and peaceful the intellect is easily fixed in Atma. Then it is all bliss and blessedness. It is like a small river emptying itself into the ocean and becoming one with it. Even the happiness of the creator Brahma is only a drop in the ocean of the bliss of the Supreme Self. What more does a man want than to merge himself in the ocean of bliss? So let every man who is punished with sorrow and suffering by his own evil, know the path of liberation, and strive for peace.",

This peace is attained by constant meditation on the Self. And meditation is possible only when the mind is in a state of balance and harmony. So the first stage is harmony and balance of mind. Such balance and harmony are the immediate results of the purified mind. It has already been pointed out that a mind free from attraction and repulsion comes to be harmonized in yoga. So without purity, there is frequent mental agitation which makes it impossible for man to meditate on Alma. Through purity, mental harmony is acquired, through harmony the power of meditation is acquired, and through meditation peace, and through peace, happiness. The negative form of the ideas and interrogation at the end proves that the Lord wants to emphasize these ideas for the guidance of the seeker. Peace is an important step for self-realisation.",

The mind follows the senses and is carried away in various ways. A simile is used to illustrate the idea. The gale carries away the ship on the waters. The ship may capsize by the gale or otherwise be damaged and lost. Likewise, the mind is driven away from Atma and wrecked on the rocks of sensual pleasures. Even a single sense-organ is capable of pulling away the mind from the spiritual goal. If all the senses rebel, what should be the fate of the man?

When the mind follows the senses and starts collecting sensory rubbish through them, it loses its prāṇa-śakti—vitality—to meditate and becomes dull. Very soon, it abducts the awareness of the Self accrued through meditation. Here, the prajñā has not become steady. …. …..There is a point to be noted here. When the mind follows the senses, it affects the intellect. Here the senses are not said to be the cause of the fall of the intellect; but the mind is. This is because it is the mind that acts through the senses, and it is subtler than the senses.

The man of steady wisdom, the sthitaprajna is compared to the ocean. Though the waters of the ocean are drawn up by the sun in the form of clouds, it is not reduced in any way. So also, though rains and floods join the ocean, it does not expand. It remains the same, immovable. In the same way, the sage of steady wisdom remains unmoved, when all desires flow into him without producing any reactions of the mind or the body. All the enjoyments of the sense-world may come to him, but they are all absorbed in the blissful experience of the Self. He does not recognize them as anything other than the bliss of Self-realisation. He may be put in a palace surrounded by all earthy pleasures. And yet he is indifferent to them. He knows only one Reality one happiness, in which everything is dissolved as all the waters are absorbed by the ocean.

And just as the ocean is full and immovable, the Jnani is firm, immovable, and changeless, in all the states and conditions of life. Small wells, tanks, and reservoirs are not like the ocean. When floods come, they overflow, cut the bund and cause damage. When there is drought, they dry up and look like empty pits. They change. But the ocean is changeless.

They should first of all understand that they have become slaves to certain modes of thought and action, which they have themselves created in previous births. Knowing it, they should undertake some form of discipline, and by their own effort overcome bad by good karma, surrender the fruits of work to the Lord, and gradually purify their mind, and become Jeevanmuktas in the end. Bhagavad Gita 3.5 by Swami Sarvapriyananda Swami Vivekananda Says — Making Swami Akhandananda the subject of his remarks, Swamiji said to the disciple, “Mark you, what a great hero he is in work! Of fear, death and the like he has no cognisance — doggedly going on doing his own work — ‘work for the welfare of the many, for the happiness of the many’.”",

[Source] Swami Saradananda is a glowing example of a person who could keep his mind in God, or the Self, and at the same time his hands at work. A real yogi regards the Self as actionless even while being engaged in action. Activity belongs to the body, the senses, and the mind, and does not affect the unchanging Self. The Gita says, “Great is the man who controls the senses with his mind and engages them in selfless actions” (3.7). Monks tend to go into seclusion for meditation, giving up action.

But he wants his disciple to understand the principle behind work. One should understand it correctly and go into action. Otherwise he is caught in the meshes of karma. The law of work is thus explained here. 1. Yajna should be done as an act of dedication to God and as a service to humanity. 2. Yajna should be done without any attachment for the fruits thereof. Work done in this spirit, though it is of a common quality is transformed into a great yajna. Work then becomes worthier. It purifies and liberates.

Do your best. Work yourself to death, if need be. Nothing but good will come of it.",

I am sure he will provide all necessary help in time. Do not worry. “I do not at all like the idea of separating work from worship. Work is worship. All work is His service. I have seen that people who practise austerities in solitude often become selfish. But the worker has to mix and live with many for the sake of his work and has thus to cultivate patience, sympathy, love, and selflessness. Besides Upasana (worship) also is work, and its fruits also have to be dedicated to the Lord. ” (Source: Spiritual Talks by the First Disciples of Sri Ramakrishna) Bhagavad Gita: Chapter 3 🔻 (43 Verses) 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43",

He knew that man would plunge into all kinds of action and get himself caught in the wheel of samsara, and suffer pain and sorrow endlessly. So along with man, the Creator introduced into the world several types of yajnas which would help mankind in their journey through life to final perfection. Yajna means an act of dedication to God or service to humanity or meditation on God the Supreme Reality. Milk-cow of desires: The yajna is said to yield all the good things that man needs in his journey through life. Man needs above everything else the removal of sorrow and the attainment of peace. They can be achieved by performing yajna. Therefore it is compared to the wish-fulfilling Kamadhenu of Heaven. Not only the spiritual welfare of mankind but also their material prosperity is answered by the performance of yajna.

We understand from this what a powerful antidote yajna is to destroy all types of accumulated sins. Divine offering, compassionate relief given to suffering fellow-beings,-this is the best remedy to kill all sins. So it is said in the Esavasyopanishad – “From what you have, give something as a sacrifice to the Gods or other fellow beings, and eat the remaining portion.” The selfish who cooks and eats all to satisfy his own bodily needs is indeed eating not food, but sin! Such men accumulate sin They eat and digest sin and they become living embodiments Of sin.

To eliminate these sins, the Pancha maha yajnas are prescribed. They are (1) Deva Yajna (2) Brahma Yajna (3) Pitri Yajna, (4) Nri Yajna and (5) Bhuta Yajna. The Vedic tradition has prescribed many types of yajnas to eliminate the sins committed in the course of innumerable births. The generalisation is that all sins would be cleared by sacrifice.

When the daughter-in-law of the house becomes pregnant, she cannot do much work. Her mother-in-law gradually lessens her duties in the house. When her time arrives she does practically nothing. And after the child is born her only work is to play with it. She doesn’t do any household duties at all. The sandhya merges in the Gayatri, the Gayatri in Om, and Om in samadhi. It is like the sound of a bell: t — a — m . The yogi, by following in the trail of the sound Om, gradually merges himself in the Supreme Brahman. His sandhya and other ritualistic duties disappear in samadhi. Thus the duties of the jnani come to an end.” (Source: Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna ) —– In order to perform the worship of God",

Wealth and lands, power and position could be won and lost. But emancipation and God-realisation is a blessing to humanity. So the Lord advises Arjuna to work, not only for self-purification but to show the path of work to mankind and help the masses by his personal example. Bhagavad Gita 3.20 by Swami Sarvapriyananda Sri Ramakrishna Says — Referring to Keshab’s association with “woman and gold”, which had hindered his work as a spiritual teacher, Sri Ramakrishna said to Vijay, “He — do you understand?” VIJAY: “Yes, sir.” MASTER: “He couldn’t achieve very much because he wanted to satisfy both God and the world.” VIJAY: “Chaitanya said to Nityananda: ‘Nitai, I shall not be able to do the people any good unless I renounce the world. All will imitate me and want to lead the life of a householder. No one will try to direct his whole mind to the Lotus Feet of God, renouncing “woman and gold”.'” MASTER: “Yes.

Naturally, they act in the same way. What the elders do, children imitate. We see this daily very often that to justify one’s actions, one refers to the example of great men. So, as a man acquires leadership, comes to occupy a prominent position, he should be extremely careful about what de does. It is the social responsibility of that man to live up to a high standard of moral and spiritual conduct. Individually a man may be a Jnani. He may not be bound by any kind of action. But so long as he is in an embodied state, his outer life should be perfectly befitting the injunctions of the Sastras. Generally, when one comes across a realised saint, he regards him as the standard of excellence, as an example and demonstration of Sastric law in actual life. Thus he has a social responsibility to show the right way to the masses by following the Sastras. What the great people and leaders do, is copied by the common man. Yatha",

So, for the protection and welfare of all the worlds, I work. Thus the Lord proves the need for the discipline of karma yoga in the world. The Lord is the cosmic intelligence who gives the law for the orderly evolution of the Universe. The plan of the Universe and its orderly functioning is due to the will of the Lord. Let us imagine what would happen to mankind on the globe if the laws of the universe are relaxed for a brief while. The whole world would crash into destruction. The pride of human intelligence appears childish when one contemplates the beneficent power that keeps the planets in their orbits. So the Lord says that if he does not work the world would perish. The same law applies to the various duties and functions of man for the orderly maintenance and progress of humanity. The",

The wise act without attachment to the fruits of work. The ignorant act with attachment to the fruits of work. The wise are not entangled in work because they have no sense of doership. The ignorant are caught in the meshes of work by thinking that they are the doers. The wise work for the welfare of the world. The ignorant work for their own satisfaction. Work is common to both. But what a world of difference in purpose and spirit. Therefore the wise attain liberation through work and the ignorant are bound to the wheel of birth and death. Work is like a sword.

Thus the human organism and the universe around are the product of Nature. Atma remains as the eternal uncontaminated witness. The real man is Atma. In truth, the real man is not the doer. All the actions that man apparently performs with his physical and subtle organs is the work of Nature, and not of the man himself in his real Being. But the deluded man having identified himself with the body thinks “I am the doer,” and so thinking he burdens himself with the responsibility for all of them. The ignorant man imagines himself to be the body and thinks that he is the doer, enjoyer of all actions and the fruits thereof. The wise man seprates himself from the vehicle of the body and knows that he is the Self, that he is not the doer nor is he subject to the binding power of his actions. So let the seeker discriminate between the Self and the non-Self, and know his real nature. The secret of Karma Yoga is to understand the law how actions are performed and with what power they are performed. Such a man is called Vimudhatma.

These qualities of nature are modified into the four elements – manas, buddhi, chitta, ahamkara , the five subtle elements, the five organs of action, the five organs of perception, and the five objects of the senses. Thus the human organism and the universe around are the product of Nature. All actions wherever and in whatever manner they take place are actually done by the power of the three gunas. Atma remains as the eternal uncontaminated witness. The real man is Atma. It is the witness of the body, the internal and external organs, and the modifications of the mind. In truth, the real man is not the doer. All the actions that man apparently performs with his physical and subtle organs is the work of Nature, and not of the man himself in his real Being. But the deluded man having identified himself with the body thinks “I am the doer,” and so thinking he burdens himself with the responsibility for all of them. Consequently, he",

The ignorant man imagines himself to be the body and thinks that he is the doer, enjoyer of all actions and the fruits thereof. The wise man seprates himself from the vehicle of the body and knows that he is the Self, that he is not the doer nor is he subject to the binding power of his actions. Joy and sorrow depend upon the idea of doership. If you think you are the body, you have to bear pain and grief and all the innumerable ills of life. If you think you are the Self, you are at the source of all bliss. So let the seeker discriminate between the Self and the non-Self, and know his real nature. Then all that he does is sublimated into the Self and remains unaffected. The secret of Karma Yoga is to understand the law how actions are performed and with what power they are performed.

    "text": "In the twenty-sixth verse of this Discourse , the Lord warned the man of knowledge not to confuse the mind of the ignorant by theoretical speculations, but to show the right way by acting in the right spirit. The same idea is repeated here. The ignorant who form the majority are attached to the body and consider the qualities of Nature as their own. Spontaneously they think that they are working and acting with the definite object of enjoyment of the fruits of work. Such people should not be confused by theorising about the actionlessness of Brahman, which they cannot easily understand. So the wise man ( Vidvan, tatvavit ) should show the way by himself acting without attachment, and acting always on the highest principles of righteousness. The wise have to shoulder a tremendous responsibility. His life should conform to the pattern enjoined by the Sastras, though he is himself beyond all laws, rules, and regulations. Of imperfect understanding: Those who are attached to the body, mind, and senses, are men of imperfect knowledge. Worldly wisdom, knowledge of Sastras, learning, capacity to interpret the scripture, oratorical powers – all these and more do not qualify a man to be",

Man of perfect knowledge: Perfection of knowledge consists in realising the Self, knowing which man knows everything. The sages of yore directed their enquiring not so much to the objective world outside but to discover in themselves the secret of their being. They discovered the all-pervading Atma, and were satisfied because they realised that the whole universe is Atma and nothing else is the material and efficient cause of all that exists. They have thus become free from the delusion of the limited ego. They have become the possessors of perfect knowledge, bliss and blessedness. This should be the aim and goal of every seeker who is eager to know the Truth in the midst of the thousand and one ills and shocks of mortal life. This is the only way to peace.

If a wood-cutter or soldier or teacher or politician should realise the Truth, he should not for that reason change himself or something else in the social structure.

The Kshatriya continues to fight the enemy and defend his country, but he knows that he is not the same person who is doing the work. Thus the concept of Hinduism is not a negation of action, but a proper understanding of the feeling of action which enables the actor to act without passion, without elation of hope or the frustration of failure.

Man should not come under the sway of the material forces operating in the human personality. That is the Lord’s injunction. So the whole progress of spiritual life is one continuous and systematic attempt to counteract the natural forces till they are completely subdued. All the different paths, methods, practices and disciplines have only one end in view, and that is the conquest of Nature in all its subtle forms and manifestations. Each of the five senses has a double current running in opposite directions. When the object is pleasing, it is delighted; when the object is disagreeable, it is pained: Attachment and repulsion are formed. So when the senses come into contact with the multifarious objects of the world, it is sometimes attached to them, and sometimes repulsed from them. The same object may be pleasing sometimes and under changed conditions may cause pain. These reactions of the senses are termed ‘raga’ and `dvesha’ . These are inherent in the sense-world. The entire spiritual discipline is to",

One who has acquired such equanimity is a Yogi, a Sthitaprajna . Attachment and repulsion (Raga and Dvesha) are the eternal enemies of the spiritual aspirant. These pairs of opposites have long-established their sway on the mind and the senses. And when man, by an enlightened consciousness, tries to equalise the reactions, the mind and the senses would stoutly refuse to submit to the new discipline. Thoughts and habits react. The aspirant has to remain firm and unyielding, and only then would he be able to stamp his will and attain mastery over the opposing forces. Devotion to God, selfless work, meditation on the real Self, grace of a Guru, are helpers to secure victory. Till then there is no rest or peace for man. When enemies enter a village they are dangerous, when they enter the house, they are still more dangerous; and when they find a place in one’s own heart, the danger is greatest. Raga and Dvesha are internal enemies. “Do not fall under their sway” is the Lord’s command. The internal",

She is Vidya or the Intelligence-Principle of Vishnu-Sakti or Maya and She is the Avidya or the Ignorant principle too, and is above both.

She is the giver of pleasure, Svarga and Moksha to Her devotees at the same time. Markandeya said: Hearing these words of the Rishi, the King Suratha was very much moved at heart and immediately started to dense forests to perform rigorous penance. The Vaisya also followed him and began to perform Tapas on the bank of the river reciting Devi Suktam continuously.

Whatever you want you can tell Me now. I am pleased with you.

But the Vaisya asked from Devi Wisdom and nothing else. The Devi said, “O king! In a few days you will regain your kingdom. You will conquer your enemies and rule over the land happily.

Knowing full well that an act is evil, and sincerely wishing to avoid it, man, however, does it in spite of himself. This is within the experience of all human beings. The Lord analyses the force, and says that the twin evils of kama and krodha constitute the power behind all the sins committed by man. Kama and Krodha are wicked twins like Ravana and Kumbhakarna, like Hiranyaksha and Hiranyakasipu. The aforesaid raga and dvesha are manifestations of kama and krodha . Of these two, kama is the first and krodha is but the effect of kama. The first is the cause and the second is the effect. When there is no cause there can be no effect. When there is no kama, there is no krodha. Kama is therefore said to be the first of the six evil tendencies in man – Kama, Krodha, Lobha, Moha, Mada and Matsarya. Kama is the captain of the team of inimical forces which harass mankind, and stand directly in the way of Self-realisation. The Lord describes Kama and Krodha by",

Fire is not extinguished so long as you pour oblations of oil and ghee into it. They only add to its consuming power. Such is kama. The attempt to satisfy it only makes it stronger and more clamorous for further and further enjoyment. How then can it be conquered? Let no fuel be added to the fire and the fire weakens and dies in ashes. So also, let no attempt be made to satisfy kama, and it dies a natural death . The rejection of desire as soon as it is born is the way to overcome it. Constant inquiry into the nature of the Self, which is bliss itself, will naturally eliminate desires from the mind . When man by his birth-right is the very source and fountain-head of all bliss, why does he need small external objects to give him joy and pleasure?

When kama is frustrated it takes the ugly form of krodha (wrath). Again they are described as the foes of man. They are the nearest and the greatest enemies of man. Through a series of births, they have acquired an undisputed mastery over the heart of man. Having occupied the innermost recesses of the heart, they have been exercising control and authority over man’s impulses and conduct in the material world. The whole personality of man is thus enslaved by a secret and powerful enemy for a long time. They have brought their associates also – Iobha, moha, mada and matsarya – into the inner part of man’s heart. These evils act with wonderful co-ordination. If one is suppressed another comes up. If that is suppressed, the former crop up again.

The stronghold of kama is the senses, the mind, and the intellect. With these under its power, kama veils the knowledge of Self and deludes mankind by attachment to the body and the material world. So the first step for the seeker is to bring the senses under his own control, by driving out kama from its stronghold. Then the mind becomes pure, and the discriminative intellect clear. When kama is thus driven out of its hiding place and feeding ground, it becomes weak and gradually dies for want of sustenance.

Hiranyakasipu, the king of the demons and father of Prahlada, had put his son to endless torture to divert the boy’s mind from the love of God. But through divine grace all the king’s attempts to kill Prahlada were ineffective. At last God appeared, assuming the form of Nrisimha, the Man-lion, and killed Hiranyakasipu. The gods were frightened at the rage and roaring of the Man-lion and thought that the destruction of the world was imminent. They sent Prahlada to pacify the Deity.

It can also be triggered by memory when the mind recollects earlier pleasurable experiences. The third source of desire is the intellect: thinking of and anticipating future pleasures. Such thoughts stimulate desire. Therefore, it is imperative to be extremely alert about what we see, remember, and think. Thus, to sum up, the senses perceive things in the present, the mind recalls pleasures enjoyed in the past while the intellect dwells on the pleasures sought after in the future. Desires also have their own character, and the nature of the desire is dependent on the kind of thoughts entertained. One type is of an extremely tāmasika nature, which pertains to obscene and vulgar things. The sight of rājasika things will give rise to rājasika desires. Sāttvika memories such as that of Chinmaya Vibhooti, for example, will engender the sāttvika desire of revisiting that Centre. Tāmasika and rājasika desires create bondage.

If the enemy is attacked and repelled at the gate, he cannot enter the fort. The senses should not be allowed to possess the mind by filling it with sense objects of pleasure. So the senses should be controlled first. The enjoyments derived through the senses should be given up by the practice of discrimination and dispassion. This is the starting point of spiritual advancement. The Lord says to every seeker “Whatever other obstacles and difficulties there may be, look to this first. Control the senses. Other things shall follow later.” Therefore let every seeker examine the outgoing senses, and find out the objects towards which they are running.

A ball of iron is illumined when fire enters and pervades it. So Atma enters and pervades the whole universe, giving it the appearance of life and activity. All this life belongs to Atma. He is the Reality in everything. So, keeping oneself in the Atmic state is the most powerful antidote to the intellect. When one acquires a stand in Atma, these lower functional instruments are deprived of the usual ramblings in the world of matter, and so they automatically come to a standstill in their own respective positions. They can no longer draw the person out and entangle him in the meshes of sense-enjoyments. Even the relish or taste for enjoyment is killed when Atma is directly perceived and experienced. Thus the Lord points out the way to conquer the senses, the mind, and the intellect, all at once. ‘Never descend to the lower plane of the senses. All should ascend to the state of Atma’,- this is the injunction of the Lord. The lower things then cannot trouble the person for he",

Thus, having known what is greater than the intellect (i.e.) Atma, and restraining the mind by the intellect conquer the foe (kama) in the form of desire which is indeed hard to overcome. The cause of all sorrow is the ignorance of man of his real Self. So the Lord exhorts all mankind, “Know that you are the Self which is beyond the intellect You are not the body. So take refuge in the Self and conquer the indomitable foe – Kama.” This is the Lord’s inspiring message to suffering humanity. In fact, it is Atma that impregnates all material things with consciousness, power and activity. Thus Kama is conquered, the bonds of ignorance are broken, the Power of the Supreme is realised. Then all that is not Atma loses its mysterious power over the individual. Man then feels the freedom of the Self-the state of the jivanmukta. The ignorant man has tied a strong knot between Atma and Anatma. This knot should be cut so that insentient matter is clearly distinguished from the life and light of Atma. To the realised man, Atma alone appears everywhere, as the immovable, unchanging, imperishable, substratum of all that exists. Then these senses and the mind remain under his control and become servants to carry out the command of the master, the Self. Thus the mighty wheel of birth and death comes to a stand-still, when the Self is realised. The delusion banishes by the knowledge of Atma. The Self alone shines as the eternal Truth. Knowledge of the Self is the last word of the Lord in this Discourse, Karma Yoga, the Yoga of action. We understand that Karma yoga demands detachment and desirelessness and this is possible only when man understands Atma. So knowledge is the foundation of Karma yoga. Nishkama Karma leads to Jnana, and Jnana makes Nishkama Karma possible.

There is no other way to stop the wheel of samasara. If the phenomenal world is cut off from its deluding connection with the Self, the whole of it ceases to have any meaning or life or significance. The delusion banishes by the knowledge of Atma. The external world will be known as a mirage and no one would run after a mirage when he knows it to be such. The senses do not run after material things, the mind does not hanker after pleasures and enjoyment, and the intellect has no more any part to play in the scheme of things.

The aspirant should be like Arjuna, a hero who knows no defeat, who is ready to sacrifice his life for attaining the highest. His motto should be ‘Conquer’. But what kind of foe is he to conquer? The foe to be conquered is hard indeed to overcome (durasadam). It is no use to underestimate the power of the enemy. The enemy (Kama) is powerful because it has sent its roots deep into the heart of man and has developed into a mighty many-branched tree. It should be cut and the roots pulled out of the solid earth. The sword that can cut this mighty tree of Kama is detachment from the unreal and identification with Atma. This is the axe which would cut the mighty tree.

    "text": "The spiritual path of Karma Yoga is not a new invention. It is an ancient path. But owing to the change of times, it was covered up and neglected for some time. But it is imperishable. When spiritual Dharma suffers decline, the Lord incarnates Himself to re-establish it. Great spiritual men like Sankara and others come into the world to reclaim the declining Dharma and re-establish it in the world. This same ancient knowledge is now taught to Arjuna by Lord Krishna. Why should the Lord choose Arjuna only to be the recipient of this knowledge? This is answered by this verse. Arjuna was a devotee and a friend of the Lord. Therefore this supreme secret was revealed to him. Whoever loves the Lord is His friend and devotee. On him, the Lord bestows supreme knowledge. So one should acquire the faith and devotion of Arjuna, and to such a man the Lord Himself offers all the secrets of spiritual knowledge. The Lord has no attachment of friend or foe. Whoever loves Him receives His love and compassion. Arjuna’s faith in the Lord has won for him a place in the heart of Krishna, and hence the divine message was",

Arjuna’s doubt is the doubt of all ordinary human beings, and so the Lord’s answer is intended to enlighten mankind about the mystery of His incarnation in the world. Indeed, Lord Krishna is not a material form composed of the five elements as is the body of a human being. He is the eternal all-pervading Supreme Being of the Universe. This very truth is declared by the Lord in his reply to Arjuna. This universe and all that is in it can be looked at from three planes of vision.

The former two are relative truths. The last is the absolute Truth. To distinguish this relative from the Absolute, and hold on to the Absolute is the aim of spiritual Sadhana.

When the embryo in the mother’s womb attains the seventh month, he gets the vision of his past births for a brief time and then, he vows to the Lord that he would strive to dedicate his present birth to Self-realisation. But as soon as he comes out of the mother’s womb, he forgets all and is lost in the pleasures and pains of earthly existence. Such is the power of Maya. Let people not forget that they have had the same pleasures and pains during myriads of births, and when they realise this, they lose all taste and resort for worldly attachments and pleasures. Then comes true renunciation, and the march to their original state of perfection begins. So the Lord tells Arjuna that he (Arjuna) had several births in the past, though he is not able to recollect them on account of his mortal nature.

The Mother offered 108 golden leaves shaped like the real leaves of the bel (vilva) tree. She stayed in that small town for three days and every morning and evening she would visit the temple and perform worship with flowers, chandan (sandal) and vilva leaves.

He is himself the Supreme Lord and master of the whole universe and rules over it by His mysterious power of Maya. Why then should he take birth? It is for the purpose of doing good to the world. He takes a form by His own will, using the power of Maya as His instrument. Three attributes of the Lord are mentioned here. He has no birth (Ajah). He is eternal (Avyayatma). He is the Supreme Lord of all beings (Bhutanam isvarah).

    "text": "The essence of the Upanishadic declaration “Brahmavit Brahmaiva bhavati” is restated in this verse. One who knows Brahman becomes that. Between knowing and becoming, there is no distinction in Brahmavidya. It is different in the objective world; there the knower and the known are different. But in the realm of the Self, knowing and becoming are one. In other words, only he who knows Him becomes Brahman. But what is this knowing of Brahman? It is certainly not an intellectual conclusion, drawn by logic and argument from a study of the Sastras. One may be convinced by the logical argument that Brahman alone is real, and yet he may be far far away from realising Him. This is not knowledge of Brahman. Knowing Brahman means the direct experience of Atma which is beyond the body, senses mind and intellect. This is to know Brahman in the essence (Tattatah). In this verse, the Lord states that he who knows the essential principle of His divine birth and action enters Him and has no further birth. By deep mediation and ecstasy of devotion, man becomes one with the Lord. To know the nature of the Lord is Sadhana , and to become",

    "text": "In this Discourse, the Lord describes the merits of Jnana in different ways, such as Tapas, Yajna, Agni, Nauka and Khadga . Here Jnana is described as tapas, a penance of wonderful merit because it cleanses all accumulated sins of previous births and all the impurities of inherited instincts, impulses and tendencies. Such men who are purified by this penance are mentioned as purified ( Putah ). What are the marks of this Jnana tapas? Freedom from desire, fear and hatred, intense devotion and absorption in the Lord, seeking ultimate refuge in Him, – these are the aspects of Jnana tapas. What is its effect? Attaining the Lord, Self-realisation through purity is the reward. Free from desire, fear and hatred: Attachment to worldly objects, fear and hatred, form the triple-headed monster who should be killed and destroyed. Is it an easy task? How to destroy them? The Lord points the way. He says, ‘think of me, be absolved in me, take refuge in me.’ That is the way to conquer the enemy. As man acquires greater and greater firmness in Jnana, these obstacles are gradually cleared from the mind, and that very moment when the mind is destroyed, the supreme",

When his wealth is gone, his friends and kith and kin desert him, making him sink into utmost sorrow and despair. 9. When his further efforts to gain wealth also fail, thanks to My will, he becomes filled with dispassion and gets association with My devotees. On such a one I bestow My grace. 10. For this reason people do not adore Me, the Supreme Brahman, who is extremely subtle, being of the nature of pure Existence-Consciousness-Bliss, unlimited and impossible to be conceived with an impure heart. Men therefore adopt usually the worship of other deities. 11.

They only have got the idea of bondage, which other creatures have not. Only when there is the idea of bondage, can there be any real effort for liberation.

In that birth when he retired in his old age from the duties of the King to lead a life of contemplation in a forest he became attached to the young one of a deer which had lost its mother. As a result he turned away from God and in his next birth was born as a deer. In his birth after that he was again born as a man and attained realization. In this last birth he was known as Jada Bharata for he lived as one inert and idiotic for fear of getting bound again by worldly ties. ] Bhagavad Gita: Chapter 4 🔻 (42 Verses) 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11",

The idlers refuse to do any work; they are too lazy or too weak in body to perform any work.

But they are always in a state of action because their minds wander about all over the world, think and perform a thousand forms of work, and they live a restless and tortured life.

So even though he works he cannot have any attachment for the fruits of work. Self-control leads to Atmajnana. When the senses and the mind are restrained, naturally man becomes free from the enticing temptation of the material world with all its glamour and attraction. When such a man works, he has no feeling of attachment for any material object at all. The third attribute ` aparigraha ‘ should be carefully noted by the aspirant. Non-receiving of gifts and possessions is enjoined by the Sastras as a very important discipline for the seeker. When one receives gifts from others he takes with them part of the karma of the giver. The very purpose of the seeker (i.e.) to get rid of karma is defeated. Why should he add to his own load the sins of others by receiving worthless possessions of material things? Non-receiving ( Aparigraha ) is therefore enjoined as the rule",

It is this fundamental truth that is affirmed in this verse by the illustration of yajna. The oblation is Brahman. The material used is Brahman. The fire is Brahman. The sacrifice is Brahman. The act of sacrifice is Brahman. Thus contemplating, man realises Brahman everywhere and in all things.

The principle is applicable to everything and every action that man does. He is blessed who acts in the understanding and experience of the truth that all is Brahman.

They worship different Gods, meditate on them, pray to them and in many ways please the Gods. They may be termed Karmayogis or Bhaktiyogis. (2) Others perform sacrifice to Brahman by offering his separate individuality (jiva) as oblation in the fire of Brahman. Fire consumes everything and converts all into its own element. Similarly, the whole of the objective world melts into Brahman. The mind and ego are also objective phenomena pertaining to the inner nature of man. So the yogis offer them as oblation in the fire of Brahman (i.e.) they are absorbed into Brahman and lose their separate limited personalities. These are the Jnanayogis. This sacrifice leads to identity with Brahman ultimately. By inquiring into the real nature of man, by indisposition towards the objects of the world, by the eradication of bad samskaras, the mind which keeps up the illusion of duality is so purified that it is merged in Brahman. This is the liberated state of the jnanayogi. This is Brahmajnana . Bhagavad Gita 4.25 by Swami Sarvapriyananda Bhagavad Gita: Chapter 4 🔻 (42 Verses) 01",

    "text": "The technique of breath control is described here as a form of sacrifice. In the science of Ashtanga Yoga, the fourth stage is Pranayama. This practice is helpful in removing the diseases of the body and keeping the mind still. Pranayama has three parts. Breathing in is called Puraka ; expelling the breath is called Rechaka ; and retention of breath is called Kumbhaka . Pranayama is often accompanied with some holy mantra like OM. Breathing (Prana) is closely connected with the operations of the mind. It is everybody’s experience. When a gust of passion disturbs the mind, the breath becomes at once irregular, and as the passion cools down the breath also becomes normal. When the breath is irregular owing to some physical exertion, it is again impossible to concentrate the mind. So regularity of breathing always accompanies mental concentration. By controlling the breath, the mind is also controlled. For this reason, breath control is prescribed as a healthy and helpful practice in spiritual life. The seeker has to learn the technique from a competent master. Here breath-control is mentioned as a form of sacrifice. Bhagavad Gita 4.29 by Swami Sarvapriyananda",

No one should commit the mistake of doubting what connection there is between food and spiritual attainment. Without fear of any exaggeration, it can be asserted that food is the first thing about which the seeker should be extremely careful. Otherwise, all his effort will come to naught. Over-eating or under-eating, eating at all odd times, in all places, all types of food from all kinds of persons, – all these should be carefully avoided. It is food that is turned into physical energy which in its turn is turned into mental energy that leads to spiritual illumination. Impure food not only unhinges the physical body but also irritates and provokes all kinds of undesirable humours which are detrimental to self-control. Some kinds of food like meat, garlic, and spices induce physical aberration like indulgence in sex and irritability of temper, cruelty in word and deed, and other discordant impulses. They are all obstacles to spiritual progress. Just as a loose nut in a complicated machine brings it to a standstill, just as a train",

There are five conditions to determine the quality of food (1) purity (2) moderation, (3) righteous earning, (4) offering to the Lord, and (5) timeliness. The Lord has described various spiritual disciplines and each of them is given the sacred name of yajna. We understand that the old concept of yajna as a Vedic ritual accompanied by elaborate technique is given up, and a new significance is attached to other forms of discipline. Besides, it is here affirmed that all those who practise any of these disciplines are knowers of sacrifice (vajnavidah) . What then is the use of yajnas? It is the first and last method of purification. All the sins of the past and all the evil tendencies of the mind are destroyed by yajna.

The purified mind merges in Atma, and Atma alone shines in its original untainted light. This is the Atmic state, the realisation of Brahman. How wonderful is the fruit of sacrifice! The greatness of the result is proof of the excellence of the cause. Yajna is the cause and the result is the direct realisation of Brahman. In this world, man endures all troubles for the purpose of acquiring a bit of wealth or pleasure or fame. After all, they are brief and short-lived.

So, action well-planned and executed with resolution is the cause of yajna. Individual effort is essential for the performance of Yajna. Inaction leads to nothing. Spirituality is indeed a practical science and not an empty talk. So the seekers should use each one of their faculties, physical and mental, for the purpose of performing these sacrifices. Such determined action alone can yield the highest fruit of liberation. The Lord exhorts all mankind to take to a life of action, perform yajna, purify the mind, and attain Brahman.

First know for certain what they are doing — which more than ninety per cent of the revilers are thoroughly ignorant of — and then it will explain itself in the light of the Vedantic philosophy. Still these karmas are not compulsory. On the other hand, open your Manu and see where it orders every old man to embrace the fourth ashrama, and whether he embraces it or not, he must give up all karma. It is reiterated everywhere that all these karmas “finally end in jnana”. [Source]",

The Knowledge received from the Brahmanishta Guru consists of (1) the removal of all former delusions forever, and (2) the perception of all beings in one’s own Self and also in God. Thus the proof of Brahmajnana is the clearing away of all delusions which have been haunting man from time immemorial. Atma, the Self, is alone real and all else is an illusion. But when all is seen as Atma, as God Himself, there can be no delusion, and when there is no delusion, there is no sorrow. The Lord teaches him that he would never again be the victim of such delusion any time thereafter when he obtained Brahmajnana from the Master. The seeker should constantly examine himself: Am I free from delusion? In this way, everyone should thoroughly cleanse his mind day after day and purify the senses and the mind.

Thus the proof of Brahmajnana is the clearing away of all delusions which have been haunting man from time immemorial. Atma, the Self, is alone real and all else is an illusion.

The degree of faith in the Sastras and the teaching of the Guru, determine the degree of success. The greater the faith the sooner the success.

Doubt is the very negation of faith and want of faith results in utter failure. That is why the Lord insists on faith as an indispensable condition for the aspirant. The sick man should have faith in the physician and the medicine prescribed by him. Otherwise, the efficacy of the medicine is neutralised by the negative attitude of the patient. As the Sadhaka practises the discipline sincerely at first, he would gain some simple spiritual experience, which would confirm his faith in the higher laws of spirituality. It should be understood that Faith is not a denial of one’s reason and judgment. What is implied is that the seeker should carry out the instructions of the Sastras and the Gure in the full hope that",

Divided aims and distracted minds achieve nothing. The personality of man, complete and entire, should be dedicated to the spiritual aim. He should fully realise within himself that there is no other goal to strive for. Naturally, by discrimination, when it is known that all other things are painful perishable worthless stuff, the spiritual aim alone shines as a perfect star. Then Self-realisation becomes possible.

He may be continuously working, and yet he is not in action as he has no feeling of attachment and doership. The fire of Knowledge burns up all actions, as it has been already declared.

How then is this worship of Nârâyana different from meditation? It may be one cannot serve in this spirit, but one has no right therefore to call it inferior. Swamiji proclaimed this new path after realizing the Self as immanent in all things. But people do not understand it, and so want to move in the old grooves of spiritual practice. Three days of such service done in the right way will bring about spiritual realization. Such indeed has been the experience of everyone who has tried it. K-has told me that in those days when he was working in the hospital, he would always feel highly lifted up in spirit. Is not every man God Himself? ‘The Lord abides in every heart.’ If one fails to realize this, it is one’s own fault, none else’s. “Once when I made known to Shri Ramakrishna that my life’s ideal was to attain Nirvâna, he reproved me for entertaining such a low ideal.

It is the unwavering conviction of the jnani that Brahman alone is real and the world illusory. All these names and forms are illusory, like a dream. What Brahman is cannot be described. One cannot even say that Brahman is a Person. This is the opinion of the jnanis, the followers of Vedanta philosophy. “But the bhaktas accept all the states of consciousness.

Similarly, the expert in Karmayoga is engaged in a thousand activities, but he is not touched or tainted by sin in any way. By the Knowledge he has acquired, he knows that all objects and actions are only reflected images in the Supreme Brahman. Having themselves escaped from the torments of karma, they work for the spiritual uplift of humanity. They are free because they know the Truth, and they have surrendered everything to the Lord or the eternal Brahman. Just as water cannot wet the lotus leaf, so work cannot bind the unselfish man by giving rise to attachment to results. The selfless and unattached man may live in the very heart of a crowded and sinful city; he will not be touched by sin. [Source] So karma-yoga says, first destroy the tendency to project this tentacle of selfishness, and when you have the power of checking it, hold it in and do not allow the mind to get into the ways of selfishness. [Source] If a man plunges headlong into foolish luxuries of the world without knowing the truth, he has missed his footing, he cannot reach the goal. And if a man curses the world, goes into a forest, mortifies his flesh, and kills himself little by little by starvation, makes his heart a barren waste, kills out all feelings, and becomes harsh, stern, and dried-up, that man also has missed the way. Work incessantly, holding life as something deified, as God Himself, and knowing that this is all we have to do, this is all we should ask for. We have seen how false desires are the cause of all the misery and evil we suffer, but when they are thus deified, purified, through God, they bring no evil, they bring no misery. The hermit said to himself in utter amazement: ‘Why, he is a butcher and a worldly man! How can he give me the Knowledge of Brahman?’ But the hunter was a knower of Brahman and had acquired divine knowledge through the performance of his worldly duties. Protect the Self by renunciation. For you, who cherish such a desire and regard yourself as a man, there is no other way by which you can keep work from clinging to you. – Avadhuta Gita 2.30 Not contaminated by any evil —The Brahma Sutras (an authoritative text of Vedanta) says: “On the realization of that Brahman, there occur the non-attachment and destruction of the subsequent and previous sins respectively, because it is declared by the scriptures.” ( 4.1.13 ) He cannot perform any action —Because action originates from desire, and desire originates from ignorance. ( BG 9.27 ) Thus shall you be free from the bondage of actions, which bear good or evil results. With your mind firmly set on the yoga of renunciation, you shall become free and come to Me.",

    "text": "The doctrine of Karmayoga is restated here. All actions should be surrendered in the Eternal, and all personal attachments to the fruits thereof should be given up. There should be no feeling of personal doership. Such a worker is not affected by sin. The idea is illustrated by means of a simile. The lotus leaf is in water, and yet it is not tainted by the water rolling over and around it. Similarly, the expert in Karmayoga is engaged in a thousand activities, but he is not touched or tainted by sin in any way. By the Knowledge he has acquired, he knows that all objects and actions are only reflected images in the Supreme Brahman. He is himself That. So there are no desires or attachments for him. Having themselves escaped from the torments of karma, they work for the spiritual uplift of humanity. They are free because they know the Truth, and they have surrendered everything to the Lord or the eternal Brahman. Commentary by Swami Chetanananda Swami Vivekananda Says — “Whosoever lives in the midst of the world, and works, and gives up all the fruit of his action unto the Lord, he is never touched with",

Work incessantly, holding life as something deified, as God Himself, and knowing that this is all we have to do, this is all we should ask for. God is in everything, where else shall we go to find Him? He is already in every work, in every thought, in every feeling. Thus knowing, we must work — this is the only way, there is no other. Thus the effects of work will not bind us. We have seen how false desires are the cause of all the misery and evil we suffer, but when they are thus deified, purified, through God, they bring no evil, they bring no misery.

The hermit said to himself in utter amazement: ‘Why, he is a butcher and a worldly man! How can he give me the Knowledge of Brahman?’ But the hunter was a knower of Brahman and had acquired divine knowledge through the performance of his worldly duties.

The devotees present were annoyed and asked her to at least finish the ritual worship of Gopala before going to cook. She called out from the kitchen, explaining that cooking for the hungry visitor was the arati of Gopala. For her, there was no difference between the ritual in the shrine and the act of feeding the hungry; both were worship. The Story of Serving with High Fever On another occasion, Mataji was suffering from a high fever when someone outside shouted, demanding to be fed. Despite her illness, she struggled up, cooked, and fed the person. Observers commented on how insensitive people were for not caring about her suffering. She acknowledged that while people are of various kinds (some respectful, some insensitive), ultimately, “all of them are Gopala”.

He said that no matter how many zeros you place one after another, their value remains zero. However, if you place the number “one” before them, they immediately gain value—one zero becomes ten, two become a hundred, and three become a thousand. The “One” represents God or spirituality. The “zeros” represent all other aspects of life, such as education, jobs, family, career, money, and fame. On their own, worldly pursuits (the zeros) may not count for much or bring lasting fulfillment. But if you place God (the One) first and center your life around spirituality, everything else gains deep purpose and value. The Pillar Children spin round and round while holding onto a pillar. They enjoy the high of spinning, but they are very careful to hold tight to the pillar because they know that letting go would cause them to fall and get hurt.

If the senses and a mind are not under control, even the conquest of the whole world is of no avail. Man cannot be happy. Therefore having controlled the mind and the senses the yogi rests happily in the body – (Vasi sukham aste) . The yogi should renounce all actions mentally. That is, he should give up the sense of doership and the attachment for the fruits of work. The body may work but the dweller in the body is completely at rest because he knows that the mind and the senses are functioning according to their own nature, and he the Drik (seer) is just a witness. There is no identification of the Self with the functions of nature. So the principle is to abandon all actions in the mind. The body, according to its own nature goes on acting according to its own laws. This mental renunciation is karma-Sannyasa, and not abstaining from work as idlers and incapacitated persons do. When one attains this karma-Sannyasa, he rests peacefully in his own state. He",

The Self is the ruling monarch of this nine-gated city. In ancient times every great city had high gateways in different directions. When these gateways are fortified and strongly guarded, the King remains safe and secure. But if they are undefended, enemies can easily enter and disturb the city.

It is true that the mind cannot all of a sudden become absorbed in That. The mind oscillates between the objective world on the one side, and Atma on the other. But constant, unremitting and intense practice will fix the direction of the mind towards Atma. All great men have gone through this practice. They have concentrated all their",

Sins dispelled by Knowledge: Who shall attain that state? Those who are free from sin and evil, free from ignorance and delusion, attain that state. How can sin be destroyed? By the Knowledge of Atma. So long as there is the least trace of evil, the light is not revealed. So the enveloping darkness of evil should be shattered by Knowledge. Constant thought and meditation on Atma bring spiritual knowledge to man. Is it not true that the man engaged in worldly pursuits, attains success by the concentration of all his energies on that object which he desires to acquire? Day and night, the wealthy are adding to their possessions. Most people spend their whole life and energy acquiring lands, houses, positions, name and fame. They come to possess these things by the very force of their efforts. And yet they still live in a state of fear, and suffer terrible torture of the mind. If they",

He is one of the ten Incarnations of God. (Hindu mythology speaks of ten Incarnations of God.) Brahman is immovable, immutable, inactive, and of the nature of Consciousness. When a man merges his buddhi , his intelligence, in Bodha , Consciousness, then he attains the Knowledge of Brahman; he becomes buddha , enlightened. “Nangta used to say that the mind merges in the buddhi, and the buddhi in Bodha, Consciousness. “The aspirant does not attain the Knowledge of Brahman as long as he is conscious of his ego.

A man gets whatever he asks of God. Suppose it comes to his mind: ‘God is the Kalpataru.

The wise and the ignorant could easily be distinguished by their conduct, in the same way as we could distinguish a blind man by his gait. The knower of Brahman is untroubled by the occurrence of unpleasant things, nor is he elated when good things come to him. His intellect does not waver in wear and woe. He knows by direct vision that worldly life as we see and live it with a deluded mind and confused intellect, is a dream that has no reality about it. He knows that it is a mirage, appearing to be full of water and beautiful, but only a sandy desert. Those who know the mirage are no longer deluded by its apparent attraction. In the same way, to the knower of Brahman the world is unreal (Midhya) from the spiritual point of view. So he is not moved by joy or sorrow by the diverse pattern of human existence. Of steady intellect, not deluded (sthirabudhih – asammudhar): The purified intellect of the knower of Brahman is firm and immovable, because it has transcended all fictitious notions of the world, pleasures and pains, etc. The intellect",

Not believing this truth, much less knowing it, the ignorant are deluded by thinking that happiness is coming to them through external objects. The dog biting the bone bruises its own mouth and licks its own blood thinking that it is coming from the bone. So is the ignorant man who runs after the elusive pleasures of life and is constantly cheated by them. Even after the repeated experience, he does not change his attitude. It has become a habitual way of thinking for the common man. The wise man who has enquired into the nature of things develops a different attitude. He comes to know that he is himself the source of all happiness, and so he has no attachment for the pleasures derived through the senses from the objective world.

So, first of all, there should be a clear understanding of the ephemeral character of sense-pleasures and the pain caused by them. Then comes dispassion (vairagya) – rejection of sense-pleasures. The less is sacrificed for the greater, the transitory is sacrificed for the eternal, and reflected joy is given up for real joy. From this verse we understand three important ideas: Happiness is not outside. It is inside, in Atma. External pleasures are short-lived and mixed with sorrow. Sense pleasures are obstructing the free flow of the bliss of Brahman. He who runs after them cannot experience the bliss of Brahman. Commentary by Swami Chetanananda Swami Vivekananda Says — Where is there any enjoyment but in Him? What enjoyment can there be in little clods of earth? It is the crystallised essence of infinite enjoyment that we have to seek, and that is in God. Let all our passions and emotions go up unto Him.

Since these pleasures are short-lived and worthless, the wise have no relish for them. The source of pain and sorrow: Sense – pleasures contain in their womb the seeds of sorrow and suffering. He who indulges in them should also suffer pain and sorrow arising from them. Man’s life is a bundle of pleasures and pains coming and going in an endless chain. These same pleasures have been many times in the previous births, and they will recur many times in the future also.

    "text": "The highest state of Brahmanubhuti and Moksha is mentioned here. It is evident from the previous verses that all outgoing impulses should be restricted, all external pleasures given up, and all sense-enjoyments discorded before Brahman is realised. The outgoing mind should be turned inwards. Introspection, and exploration of the inner regions of the mind and its source should be cultivated and developed. This is possible only when the windows of the senses are closed, and the mind is not in contact which sense-objects. If one gives up desires, the impulses of the mind for sensual enjoyments, possessions and all external things, then will he acquire the inner vision to see the Self and abide in it. Finds happiness within: The common man cannot find the happiness of the Self within. He imagines that he is deriving happiness from external objects. The truth is that all happiness is only in the Self, and what one thinks as happiness coming from outside is only the reflected happiness (Ananda) of the Self. The pleasures of the senses are short-lived, and contain in themselves the germs of pain and sorrow. To know this is very difficult, and man errs repeatedly. And yet the time",

So, anyone endowed with character and singleness of purpose can obtain the title of a Rishi. No one is precluded from making the attempt. The ignorant man of today may become the sage of the future. Constant sadhana transforms the common human being into a sage of wisdom, world-honoured and one with God Himself. (Brahmavit Brahmaiva bhavati). Four characteristics of the sage are mentioned here. Whose sins are destroyed: In the course of innumerable births man may have committed a number of sins prohibited by the Sastras, e.g. – theft, drunkenness, adultery, murder etc. So the mind is full of impurities. These should be destroyed by Nishkama Karma, devotion and Knowledge. Then the very sinner becomes a sage. Whose dualities are torn asunder: The illusion of manifoldness should be transcended by the perception of unity in all things. All doubts would be cleared when the Reality is seen as it",

The sage knows that there is only one Supreme Self, and that is manifesting as the many. The same Self that is in him is also in everything.

Control of mind (i.e.) destruction of the mind (manonasa). Knowledge of Atma (tattvajnana). The sage with these three qualities enjoys the bliss of absolute freedom at all times, in all places, and under all circumstances. By the Knowledge of Atma, all the tendencies (samskaras) of the mind are removed, and the mind becomes non-existent. Moksha is not for the idle and lethargic. Hence the word ‘Yati’ is used here. ‘Yati’ means one who sacrifices everything for a great ideal. The ideal of realisation is achieved only by a great deal of effort. So having faith in the words of the Sastras and the Guru, let the seeker strive for the speedy realisation of spiritual freedom. Constant meditation on Atma – the pure and perfect, will gradually purify the mind of all its evil samskaras.

He who has learnt to dance correctly never makes a false step. One cannot even believe in the existence of God until one’s heart becomes pure. “ Sri Ramakrishna looked at the devotees assembled in the worship hall and said: “It is very good to gather in this way, now and then, and think of God and sing His name and glories.

Making the breath regular and balanced by the practise of Pranayama is good for bodily health and concentration of mind. It is one of the practices of the Ashtanga Yoga. The prana and the mind are closely interlinked. If one is controlled, the other is also controlled, without any particular effort. So control of breath is a necessary practice to bring the roving mind to a state of stillness. So the Sastras have prescribed breath-control as an important aspect of sadhana.

So the spiritual aspirant equipped with renunciation should put up the board ‘No admission’ at the gate-ways of the senses. It is like a country keeping strong border patrols on its frontiers to prevent incursions from enemy forces. Having turned away from all sense-contacts, the sage centres the gaze of meditation in the middle of the eye-brows. This is called in yogic terminology ‘ Khechari Mudra ‘. If one meditates with eyes open, the mind may be distracted by sense attractions. If he closes his eyes there is the danger of sinking into sleep (tamas). So with eyes half-closed, the sage fixes the gaze in the centre of the eye-brows. In the science of Yoga, this spot is called ‘Ajnachakra’ . Others concentrate on the tip of the nose or on the ‘sahasrara’ . That practice which is",

Having balanced the breath: For most people the incoming and outgoing breaths are not rhythmical and balanced. The flow of breath in and out is irregular. Making the breath regular and balanced by the practise of Pranayama is good for bodily health and concentration of mind. It is one of the practices of the Ashtanga Yoga. The prana and the mind are closely interlinked. If one is controlled, the other is also controlled, without any particular effort. So control of breath is a necessary practice to bring the roving mind to a state of stillness. So the Sastras have prescribed breath-control as an important aspect of sadhana. With senses, mind and intellect controlled: It has already been declared that Atma is beyond the senses, the mind and the intellect. Aspiring for liberation: The yearning for freedom from the bonds of samsara is the first qualifying condition of the spiritual aspirant.

Consequently, he is the enjoyer of the fruits of all the meritorious work done by man. God is the supreme Lord of all the worlds. There is no power higher or equal to Him.

Then only is one imbued with true dispassionateness from the very beginning of life. Is Sannyasa a mere form? Our idea was that a Sannyasin is very rare. For no ordinary man is he whom Mâyâ has released from her bondage. When I saw three thousand monks at Rishikesh, then did I truly feel the difference between a true and a formal monk. A mere ochre garb does not constitute Sannyasa. “They want Sannyasa early in order to evade work. Our Master did not emphasize Sannyasa so much as realizing God. But it is true he was emphatic that knowledge of God is not possible without renunciation.”",

The Jnana yogi follows the path of introspection into himself by eliminating the senses the mind and the external world.

In this way whatever path man may follow – Jnana, Karma, Bhakti, Dhyana – the inner principle is the same (i.e.) the rejection of insentient material things.

    "text": "For the sage aspiring to ascend to yoga, action is said to be the means; and for the same sage enthroned in yoga serenity is called the means. To achieve success in Jnanayoga or Dhyana yoga, action (Nishkamakarma) is said to be the means. When success is attained in yoga and the mind approaches steadiness in the Self, a quiescent state free from action (sama) is said to be the means for deeper union with the Self. Therefore in the early stages of meditation purity has to be acquired by the practice of Nishkama karma. It means that as the aspirant approaches the Self nearer and nearer, action drops off of its own accord, even as dry leaves fall from the tree. The field of activity is thus transferred from the external world to the inner realm of the human personality. Hearing of Atma, thinking of Atma, meditating on Atma (sravana, munana, nidhidhyasa) – the seeker is disinclined to come out of the inner pursuit to active functions of the outer world with the body and the senses. The seeker has no use for them because the mind and the intellect are turned within and the ascent towards the Self is maintained steadily. So the seeker should first engage himself in righteous and devotional acts. Meditation is an intensely active state when all the energies of man are gathered together and centered in the one thought of the Self. The aspirant who is seeking yoga comes under the first stage – (the High – School Course). First, through Nishkamakarma the mind should be purified. Then meditation should become deeper and deeper till the Self is realised. As a man reaches the third stage, all actions appear burdensome, and his only aim would be to get firmly established in the Self.",

    "text": "To achieve success in Jnanayoga or Dhyana yoga, action (Nishkamakarma) is said to be the means. When success is attained in yoga and the mind approaches steadiness in the Self, a quiescent state free from action (sama) is said to be the means for deeper union with the Self. Therefore in the early stages of meditation purity has to be acquired by the practice of Nishkama karma. Afterward, as the mind becomes firm and steady by its purity, action should be gradually reduced. It means that as the aspirant approaches the Self nearer and nearer, action drops off of its own accord, even as dry leaves fall from the tree. The field of activity is thus transferred from the external world to the inner realm of the human personality. Hearing of Atma, thinking of Atma, meditating on Atma (sravana, munana, nidhidhyasa) – the seeker is disinclined to come out of the inner pursuit to active functions of the outer world with the body and the senses. He finds supreme satisfaction in being absorbed in the Self. The turbulence of the bodily organs and the senses is quelled. The seeker has no use for them because the mind and the intellect",

Such quietude of the physical and mental mechanism will enable him ultimately to reach the state where there are no thought modifications, and the Self is directly realised. Let the seekers understand the position correctly. Hasty attempts to go into meditation will be of no avail. The mind rarely falls quiet for the common man. The inherent ‘vasanas’ pull him out into the external world of action. It requires great effort to purify the mind before it can attain a calm and peaceful state when meditation becomes possible. So the seeker should first engage himself in righteous and devotional acts. Otherwise, he remains dull and inactive, and dullness of the brain is certainly not meditation. Meditation is an intensely active state when all the energies of man are gathered together and centered in the one thought of the Self. To stop action by force and drive the mind by violent effort would unhinge the personality and render it more restless and distracted. When the wound is healing, a layer of skin covers it, but if one scratches it away before the wound is completely cured, it causes another",

The path of progress may be divided into three stages: 1. The aspirant who is seeking yoga comes under the first stage – (the High – School Course). 2. The second stage is reached when meditation becomes possible by the purity of mind (Graduate Course). 3. Undisturbed absorption in the Self is the final stage (Post-Graduate Course). So the progress is gradual, not sudden and violent. First, through Nishkamakarma the mind should be purified. Then the practice of meditation should start. Then meditation should become deeper and deeper till the Self is realised. As a man reaches the third stage, all actions appear burdensome, and his only aim would be to get firmly established in the Self. He is the ‘Yogarudha’.

When the mind does not turn inwards, meditation is not possible.

When the mind finds happiness in Atma, man loses all pleasure in action. Moreover, as the mind is detached from the senses no action can take place, because contact with the external world is possible only through the senses.

Even so, the turbulent mind poisoned with lust and greed leads to destruction.

There are positively inimical people who may hate others and try to injure them in every possible way. Others are indifferent, and some others are neutral. Thus we come across different categories of people with different attitudes. The Yogi is equal-minded towards all these people. Towards the righteous and the unrighteous also he is equal-minded. How is he able to maintain this equality of vision? It is clear that all these distinctions arise with reference to the ego which has identified itself with the body. The ego-centric man is constantly reactionary to people according to their attitude towards him. If they are friends, he like them. If they are harmful foes, he hates them. It is the bodily outlook ( dehadrishti ) that is the cause of all those distinctions. For the man who has transcended the ego-idea, all that exists is only the Self and nothing else. He has realised the Self and he looks upon every thing with ‘ Atmic bhava ‘. It is the duty of all seekers to cultivate the ‘Atma-drishti’ in all things and kill",

    "text": "From this verse onwards, the practice of Dhyanayoga is explained in detail. Here the word ‘Yogi’ does not refer to one who has already attained perfection. It applies to those only who are seeking yoga (union with the Self). Five conditions are mentioned for the practice of Dhyanayoga- 1. Solitude, 2. Living in a lonely place, 3. Control of mind and body 4. Desirelessness 5 Non-receiving. Stationed in a Solitary place: The yogi should practise meditation in a lonely place. Pretenders who sit in yogic pose in public thoroughfares are cheats and beggars. The yogi practises meditation not to derive benefit or admiration from others. The aim of the yogi is to establish union between himself and God. So he should seek a solitary place where the mind is not distracted by the sights and sounds of worldly life. That is why the ancient sages sought for the solitude of mountain-caves and river-beds, to carry on their spiritual practice. The solitude of nature is itself a purifying influence, and the vast silence around induces the mood of meditation without much effort. The beauty of nature delights and calms the mind, and the turbulent impulses are subdued of their own accord.",

It is in that state that high thoughts are generated and higher spiritual experiences come to the yogi. During the time fixed for practice, he should not quit the seat or change the posture ( sthirah ). Then he should not look this side or that. The mind is distracted by looking at objects around him. He should fix the gaze on the tip of the nose and start meditation. By this, the mind becomes steady gradually. In the early stages, it is best to fix the gaze on the tip of the nose. The eyes are kept half-open and sleep is thereby prevented. It looks as though the Lord has provided the eyelids for this purpose only out of compassion for mankind.

When his own Self is everywhere what should he fear? Fear arises only when the Self is forgotten and the objective world assumes the air of reality. The Upanishads declare the same truth. To some extent, the aspirant has to cultivate dispassion and devotion by spiritual enquiry into the nature of Reality, and then only Dhyana becomes possible. Freedom from fear comes from a firm understanding of the Truth. One should know by clear rational thinking that Atma alone is the Reality and all the rest is only a painted picture caused by the interposition of name and form.

Almost all the world-movers have practised celibacy in some form or other. As the lamp cannot burn without oil, so also, spiritual life is impossible without ‘Brahmacharya’. The semen turns into energy and light. We see a peculiar light illumining the face of those who have practiced celibacy. It is said that several drops of blood becomes a drop of semen.

By so doing, the current of energy passing upwards through the nerves of the spinal column has a free and unobstructed flow towards the brain-centre called the ‘Sahasrara’ in Rajayoga. It is in that state that high thoughts are generated and higher spiritual experiences come to the yogi. During the time fixed for practice, he should not quit the seat or change the posture ( sthirah ). Then he should not look this side or that. The mind is distracted by looking at objects around him. He should fix the gaze on the tip of the nose and start meditation. By this, the mind becomes steady gradually. In the early stages, it is best to fix the gaze on the tip of the nose. The eyes are kept half-open and sleep is thereby prevented. It looks as though the Lord has provided the eyelids for this purpose only out of compassion for mankind.

When his own Self is everywhere what should he fear? Fear arises only when the Self is forgotten and the objective world assumes the air of reality. The Upanishads declare the same truth. To some extent, the aspirant has to cultivate dispassion and devotion by spiritual enquiry into the nature of Reality, and then only Dhyana becomes possible. Freedom from fear comes from a firm understanding of the Truth. One should know by clear rational thinking that Atma alone is the Reality and all the rest is only a painted picture caused by the interposition of name and form.

Unless the body is light and strong, meditation is difficult to practise. So, regulation of food and sleep is prescribed as the first condition of yoga. Generally, people think that spirituality is something not connected with the body and what they eat and how they work does not matter. It is not so. The body if not regulated is itself the chief obstacle to spiritual realisation. A sickly body subject to pain binds the mind to itself and its suffering and does not allow it to rise to the plane of thought and meditation. We know that when the body is healthy and strong, the mind becomes free from the bondage of the body and becomes capable of higher thought and imagination. Regulation of the body is therefore emphasised many times in the Gita. Moderation in sleep is also of great importance. Too much sleep produces ‘tamas’ and all the demonical forces in man find free play in that state. Even so, sleeplessness causes nervous breakdown, and man becomes unfit for any kind",

Self-control actually means the power by which man can order the body and mind to function according to the highest spiritual laws. There is no self-control for the man whose body and mind act in their own way in defiance of the spiritual laws. This principle holds good in Dhyanayoga. Enthusiastic beginners, with more zeal than wisdom, overdo the sadhana and consequently suffer discomfort and pain, and then they give up the practice altogether thinking that they are not fit for it. Overdoing a good thing is as harmful as indulgence in bad things. Young students burn midnight oil to prepare for the examinations, and in writing the examination, they become exhausted and their whole work goes in vain. Even if they pass the examination, the after-effects of over-exertion cause some disease or other. So also in spiritual Sadhana the progress should be slow, steady, and sure. Over-exertion defeats the very purpose of yoga. Ascetic torture of the body by fasting too much and sleeplessness",

    "text": "When the perfectly controlled mind rests in the Self free from longing for all enjoyments, then one is said to have attained yoga. When the mind is merged in Atma, that very moment man attains Moksha, liberation from all the ills and evils of human existence. Three aspects of Yogasiddhi are mentioned here – (1) Desirelessness, (2) Control of mind, and (3) Union with Atma. The same process is stated in Vedanta in different terminology (1) Vasanakshaya, (2) Manonasa, and (3) Tattvajnana. One is actioned by the others (i.e.) by the elimination of all desires mind ceases to exist, and the Atmajnana is realised. When Atmajnana dawns the mind with all its propensity for material enjoyment is destroyed. Desires are the shackles that bind man to samsara. When by discrimination and dispassion, desires are rooted out, the pure mind automatically merges in Atma which is the source from which it has risen. All the desires without any reservation should be given up. The mind should be brought to one focal point and remain steady at that point, namely the Self. The mind should rest in Atma alone, to the complete exclusion of everything else. When there are no desires and distractions, the mind by itself comes to rest in its own source-Atma. Such a yogi who rests steadfastly in Atma is Yogarudha. Commentary by Swami Chetanananda Mind of a Yogi by Swami Atmapriyananda Sri Ramakrishna Says — Sri Ramakrishna: “Some are born with the characteristics of the yogi; but they too should be careful. It is ‘woman and gold’ alone that is the obstacle; it makes them deviate from the path of yoga and drags them into worldliness. After fulfilling their desire, they again direct their minds to God and thus recover their former state of mind, fit for the practise of yoga. ‘Woman and gold’ alone is the obstacle to ‘yoga.",

Three aspects of Yogasiddhi are mentioned here – (1) Desirelessness, (2) Control of mind, and (3) Union with Atma. The same process is stated in Vedanta in different terminology (1) Vasanakshaya, (2) Manonasa, and (3) Tattvajnana. One is actioned by the others (i.e.) by the elimination of all desires mind ceases to exist, and the Atmajnana is realised. When Atmajnana dawns the mind with all its propensity for material enjoyment is destroyed. Desires are the shackles that bind man to samsara. When these desires disturb the mind, Dhyana is not possible. When by discrimination and dispassion, desires are rooted out, the pure mind automatically merges in Atma which is the source from which it has risen. All the desires without any reservation should be given up. The mind should be brought to one focal point and remain steady at that point, namely the Self. The least distraction draws it away from the object of meditation. The mind should rest in Atma alone, to the complete exclusion of everything else. When there are no desires and distractions, the",

Like the lamp, the mind of the yogi is effulgent with the light of knowledge, and it is also steady. The windows of the senses through which the objective world gets into the mind causing destruction are closed by perfect self-control, and so the mind remains steady and firm in meditation. Just as the orb of the Sun is clearly reflected in a pure calm lake when there are no ripples or waves, so also the Self is clearly reflected in a pure calm mind. The impure mind is unsteady and restless due to the winds of desire blowing constantly, like the light placed in a windy place.

He will not be conscious even of touch. A snake may crawl over his body, but he will not know it. Neither of them will be aware of the other. “In deep meditation the sense-organs stop functioning; the mind does not look outward. It is like closing the gate of the outer court in a house.

When a man possesses the real thing, be it a jewel or a flower, does he hanker after its image in a photograph or a picture? If he does so, it only means that he is not in",

In the mean time the Master was having great fun with the boys, treating them as if they were his most intimate friends. Peals of side-splitting laughter filled the room, as if it were a mart of joy. The whole thing was a revelation to M. He thought: “Didn’t I see him only yesterday intoxicated with God? Wasn’t he swimming then in the Ocean of Divine Love — a sight I had never seen before? And today the same person is behaving like an ordinary man! Wasn’t it he who scolded me on the first day of my coming here? Didn’t he admonish me, saying, ‘And you are a man of knowledge!’?

He sits quiet while the youngsters are making merry.” M. was then about twenty-eight years old. The conversation drifted to Hanuman, whose picture hung on the wall in the Master’s room.

Just a minute before, the devotees had been making merry in his company. Now all eyes were riveted on him. Thus for the second time M. saw the Master in samadhi. After a long time the Master came back to ordinary consciousness. His face lighted up with a smile, and his body relaxed; his senses began to function in a normal way. He shed tears of joy as he repeated the holy name of Rama. M. wondered whether this very saint was the person who a few minutes earlier had been behaving like a child of five. The Master said to Narendra and M., “I should like to hear you speak and argue in English.” They both laughed. But they continued to talk in their mother tongue. It was impossible for M. to argue any more before the Master.",

This verse is explained by Shankara as follows, ‘A man of realization is not shaken even by the pain caused by the application of a sharp weapon.’ Two ideas are brought out here.

This verse is explained by Shankara as follows, ‘A man of realization is not shaken even by the pain caused by the application of a sharp weapon.’ Two ideas are brought out here.

Now, the Lord explains the internal process of Dhyana Yoga. In these two verses, Bhagavan gives perfect guidelines on withdrawing the mind and making it abide in the Self. All the desires should be given up completely. What is the source of these desires? They are born of the ego-centric will (sankalpa). So desires are described as born from Sankalpa (samkalpa prabhavah). When there is no sankalpa (thought) there is no desire. By discrimination and dispassion, it is possible to root out Sankalpa. All desires without reservation should be given up completely. We have to note that whenever the Lord speaks of desires, he invariably refers to ‘all’ of them, because he knows that one desire leads to another, and that to a third, and they would extend to infinity if they are allowed to breed. So, the instruction is that all desires should be abandoned completely. When there are no desires, the mind is calm and collected and it can be made to rest in the Self.

The mind is restless and unsteady. In the beginning, it is never fixed on the object of meditation. It runs away and begins to think of one thousand things of worldly life. The seeker may become despondent that he would be never able to acquire steadiness in meditation. But there is no cause for despondency.

It comes and goes. The joy of Atma alone is beyond time and place and is not affected by any change of circumstances. The wise man naturally seeks the best and the highest. The Yogi who is tranquil in mind, in whom Rajasic tendencies like Kama and Krodha are brought to rest, who is free from evil, enjoys supreme joy. While all the people are running hither and thither, doing this and that, in order to secure the elusive phantom of delight and – all the time missing it – to the Yogi who lives in Brahman, joy, the best and the highest, comes of its own accord and possesses him!

    "text": "Several people ask “What is the easiest way to attain Brahman ?” The Lord answers the question here. Two practices should be followed. (1) The mind should be free from evil thoughts and tendencies. (2) It should be brought to dwell in Atma by Dhyana Yoga. The Lord emphasises the need for absolute purity of mind everywhere in the Gita. Atmajnana cannot dawn on an impure mind. The evil mind cannot merge in Atma. Attachment to material things is diametrically opposite to Atma which is unconditioned and uncontaminated by any other things. As the mind becomes purer and purer, it comes into contact with Brahman which is the source of the highest bliss. So purification of mind, and meditation on Atma are both mentioned here as the path to supreme joy. The practice should be continued constantly ( sada ). That is, in whatever manner, a man may be engaged, the memory of Atma should not be slip out of the mind. Such a yogi attains Brahmasakshatkara. No worldly object however valuable it may be can help man to touch the Reality. How can a reflection touch the Reality? How can matter possess the spirit? Only the pure mind can",

One day one of the boys came close to it, caught it by the tail, and, whirling it round and round, dashed it again and again on the ground and threw it away. The snake vomited blood and became unconscious. It was stunned. It could not move. So, thinking it dead, the boys went their way. “Late at night the snake regained consciousness. Slowly and with great difficulty it dragged itself into its hole; its bones were broken and it could scarcely move. Many days passed. The snake became a mere skeleton covered with a skin. Now and then, at night, it would come out in search of food. For fear of the boys it would not leave its hole during the day-time. Since receiving the sacred word from the teacher, it had given up doing harm to others. It maintained its life on dirt, leaves, or the fruit that dropped from the trees. “About a year later the brahmachari came that way again and asked after the snake. The cowherd",

Hearing the teacher’s voice, it came out of its hole and bowed before him with great reverence. ‘How are you?’ asked the brahmachari. ‘I am well, sir’, replied the snake. ‘But’, the teacher asked, ‘why are you so thin?’ The snake replied: ‘Revered sir, you ordered me not to harm anybody. So I have been living only on leaves and fruit. Perhaps that has made me thinner.’ “The snake had developed the quality of sattva; it could not be angry with anyone. It had totally forgotten that the cowherd boys had almost killed it. “The brahmachari said: ‘It can’t be mere want of food that has reduced you to this state. There must be some other reason.

I asked you not to bite, but I didn’t forbid you to hiss. Why didn’t you scare them by hissing?’ “So you must hiss at wicked people. You must frighten them lest they should do you harm. But never inject your venom into them. One must not injure others. (Source: Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna ) Now, it seems, an abrupt change came over the mind of Sri Ramakrishna. Tiring of the coming and going of the divine forms, and keenly feeling die need of a condition beyond the separations characteristic of relative life — the Līlā — he actually prayed to the Mother, “Give me a state where there is no separation.” For some time his mind was absorbed in what he sometimes calls the “Nitya”, sometimes the “Indivisible Satchidānanda”. He even removed from his room the pictures of gods and goddesses which hung there. In relating this the",

He says, “I began to meditate on the Primal Puruṣa, the Indivisible Satchidānanda, regarding myself as His handmaid.” We might puzzle over how it is possible to regard oneself as the handmaid of the Formless! But then, in a sense, He Who can be meditated upon can also be served; it was not at all uncommon for Ramakrishna to use terms like these for the Personal God without form. He lost the distinction, ultimately, between sacred and secular, and began more and more to perceive God in all beings. One morning while picking a leaf from the vilva-tree, as is done in preparing the worship, he loosened a bit of the bark. The tree appeared to him as full of Consciousness. Feeling that he had hurt the tree he was repentant. This mood came over Sri Ramakrishna frequently during the remainder of his life. Sometimes he could not pluck the sacred grass; or only with great difficulty could he cut a lemon, for example. “One day,” he told a group of devotees, “I was about to gather some flowers. They were everywhere on the trees. At once I had a vision of Virāṭ (God, seen",

In the ensuing period Sri Ramakrishna’s consciousness was to soar ever higher, into the Absolute Itself.

The Lord is ever alive to the devotee, and the devotee is ever alive to the Lord. No doubt all are children of the Lord.

After a few days, when that devotee came to Udbodhan, the swami said: “A few days ago I went to Belur Math and prostrated before Sri Ramakrishna.

Such a state comes when the mind has become pure.” (Source: Spiritual Talks by the First Disciples of Sri Ramakrishna) Related Articles: He who, undeluded, knows Me thus as the Supreme Self— he knows all, Ο Bhārata, and he worships Me with all his heart.

Like cream in milk, like honey in flowers, like sugar in sugar cane, God is present in – everything. So knowing that God is present in all, one should not harm others. One should have friendly feeling and kindness for all beings, and do service to them. This would be the worship of the Lord. The Yogi who has realised the oneness of all beings by perceiving the Lord as the inner reality, lives forever in the Lord. Just as the same Sun is reflected in a thousand different globules of water, just as the same man can play different parts in a drama by change of dress, just as the same gold exists in a hundred varieties of jewels, just as the same clay appears in pots of different shape and size, even so, the Lord exists in everything as the undifferentiated substratum. To worship Him and meditate on Him is the way to reach Him. The Yogi does not always remain in meditation. There are times",

Though the Yogi is engaged in a hundred practical works in the world, he lives in the Lord. This is the Lord’s declaration. Like the mariner’s compass whose needle always points to the North, the mind of the Yogi is always in union with the Lord, though he is acting in the world in a variety of ways. This becomes natural to him by long practice. So he never commits the error of thinking that he is different from others, though from a physical angle of view, every being is separate from everything else. Absorption in samadhi or work in the world is the same for him because he sees the same Reality in both. This is the secret of all-mighty works performed by the perfected Yogi for the benefit of mankind. Writing good books, delivering lectures, conversing and explaining the scriptures, relieving the poor and the suffering, organising people for holy purposes, moving and acting with common humanity, the perfected yogi lives in the Lord only, and has no idea of his being a separate individual.

So they are all pure and helpful, never impure and injurious.

Commentary by Swami Chetanananda Sri Ramakrishna Says — Prafulla finished her studies and then practised spiritual austerity for many days. Then one day Bhavani visited her; he wanted to instruct her about selfless work. He quoted to her from the Gita : “Therefore do thou always perform obligatory actions without attachment; by performing action without attachment one attains to the highest.” ( BG 3.19 ) He told her the three characteristics of disinterested action: first, control of the sense-organs; second, absence of egotism; and third, surrendering the fruit of action to Sri Krishna.

The elders compare it to a monkey, drunk and stung by a scorpion. Those who practice meditation know how the mind rebels and defies discipline. Arjuna compares it to the wind.

It can be controlled by practice and dispassion. The great teachers point out that there are ways and means of overcoming the difficulties in the control of the mind. The Lord while admitting the mind’s restlessness, encourages Arjuna that there is a way to control it, and the way is practice and dispassion. One need not fear the strength of an enemy, provided he arms himself with a mightier weapon. What if the elephant is strong, it is enough if one holds the iron rod. Lions and tigers are strong, but what of it? A powerful gun is enough to overpower them. Thus the Lord wants his disciple not to become panicky and submit to the tyranny of the mind. Though difficult, it is not impossible. Is it not difficult to conquer Mount Everest? And yet man has set his foot on the snowy peak. Is it not difficult to land on the moon?

The Lord answers that the mind can be controlled by 1. practice (abhyasa), and 2. dispassion(vairagya). Patanjali also expressed the same view. Dispassion (Vairagya) means a loathful attitude to the objective world arising out of a knowledge of its short-lived, painful, and foul nature.

Why should he yield to the temptations of wealth and luxury, when he knows that they are the very source of fear and suffering? All men long for peace. All men know that peace is not to be found anywhere in the outside world and cannot be purchased by the weight of gold or height of position. Man really seeks a purer joy and higher peace. To give up the lower pleasures is easy enough if the aim of the higher life is strong and convincing. In the world everything causes fear, and in dispassion alone is fearlessness. When dispassion develops, the mind immediately stops thinking of the external world and it is immediately drawn into the Self. The joy of vairagya is real, unobstructed, and perennial because it is the joy of the Self, pure and uncontaminated. Practice (Abhyasa) is the keynote of the Lord’s message for all spiritual aspirants.

All worldly gains have been acquired by hard work and constant application. The man who feels shy of labour remains where he is. Men of ordinary talents have risen in life by systematic practice in their professions of skill. That being so, is not practice necessary for attaining the highest Brahmananda? Therefore ‘practice’ says the Lord. Dispassion aids spiritual sadhana, and practice aids to strengthen dispassion. The body and the mind function by habit. If the habits are bad, man ruins himself, if the habits are good, man saves himself. So one should practise and develop good habits. If a man is accustomed to visit a wine bar at a particular time in the day, at that exact hour, the body and mind run for the bottle and nothing can stop him. In the same way, if a man practises meditation at a particular time for a particular period, the body and mind run for it, and nothing can stop him. It is practice.

Arjuna is a mighty warrior, a great hero and the Lord suggests that he should be able to control the mind without fear and despondency. Commentary by Swami Chetanananda Swami Vivekananda Says — “Only by practice and non-attachment can we conquer mind.” [Source] To restrain the indriyas (organs) from going towards the objects of the senses, to control them and bring them under the guidance of the will, is the very central virtue in religious culture. Then comes the practice of self-restraint and self-denial. All the immense possibilities of divine realization in the soul cannot get actualized without struggle and without such practice on the part of the aspiring devotee. “The mind must always think of the Lord.” It is very hard at first to compel the mind to think of the Lord always, but with every new effort the power to do so grows stronger in us.",

    "text": "Another doubt, quite natural to all the aspirants, crops up in Arjuna’s mind. He presents the case of an aspirant who has faith in the Guru’s teaching, who is practising self-control, but who passes away before perfection is gained in yoga. What will happen to that man? Where does he go? Has he any future, or should he start everything afresh? Will all his struggle and effort go to waste? This is a very natural doubt, for, most aspirants have a deep-seated doubt that they may not be able to attain perfection in this life. Very rarely do we come across the intense type of yogi who is determined to get the highest even in this life. So from the point of view of the vast majority of seekers, Arjuna’s question has undisputed relevancy. Bhagavad Gita 6.37 to 6.38 by Swami Chetanananda",

    "text": "‘ Fallen from both ‘ – Both may be interpreted as Svarga and Moksha, or differently as Karma and Dhyana. Arjuna’s question is relevant from the standpoint of all the aspirants. They have given up all worldly things on the one side, and on the other, they have not attained Moksha. So, apparently, such a man has lost both worlds. Having given up Vedic rites and rituals, he cannot go to Svarga, and having failed in Yoga, he cannot attain Moksha. The simile ‘rent cloud’ is appropriate, for no one can trace the existence of the cloud when it is dispersed in the sky. It is lost. Will the Yogi who dies imperfect, perish like the cloud and go to nothing? – is Arjuna’s Question.

Though Arjuna’s question pertains to the votaries of Dhyanayoga, Lord gives a general answer which embraces all those who are working on the spiritual path in different ways.

The wise man desires to be born in the line of yogis so that he could attain perfection in the shortest possible time. The Lord declares here that birth in the family of yogis is very difficult to attain ( Durlabhataram ). Commentary by Swami",

Though the body is dead and gone, yet the mind, with all the impressions acquired in previous births, live on, and when the Jiva takes another body, the former mental endowment comes to him. So he continues the sadhana exactly from the point where it came to an end when the body fell. Nothing is lost in death except the fleshy tabernacle. There is a continuity from birth to birth, and the chain continues till the moment when liberation is attained, and the mind with all its samskaras is destroyed. This view of rebirth is the only possible explanation for the disparity in the mental make-up of different individuals as we see them. The good thoughts, feelings, and actions of the past create a natural propensity for good things in this life. Even so, the bad thoughts and deeds done in the past produce a natural inclination to evil in this life. So, it is a warning to all to be careful of what force they are generating at the present moment. They should realise that they are accumulating samskaras and giving a special direction to their future life by",

It is superior to ascetic practices mentioned in the Vedas like fasting etc. It is superior to knowledge acquired from the study of sastras. It is superior to works mentioned in Vedic Karmakanda, like the worship of the sacred Fire etc. That is, meditation on Atma is superior to knowledge acquired through the study of the sastras. The knowledge attained in Dhyana is direct and conclusive since the aim of spiritual sadhana is Self-realisation. Whatever brings the aspirant directly into contact with Atma, and lifts him to that plane, should be considered superior. Dhyana has that power of taking the yogi nearer and nearer to Atma. Be thou a yogi: This is the Lord’s command to Arjuna. Having explained the process and excellence of yoga, the Lord commands his disciple to train himself as a yogi. The convincing arguments behind the command show how the Gita follows the rational path of judging first and decision next. Everything is examined on its own merits, and conclusions are drawn after a thorough understanding of the subject. So it is not blind faith that the Lord is expecting from his disciple. It is faith born",

In this verse, the Lord states that the yogi who worships Him, the Absolute, with faith, is the greatest of all yogis. Lord Krishna is himself the supreme in-dwelling Self of all, and so when the Lord says “Worship Me,” it is taken to mean “be united with Me, the Self, the Absolute.” Or from the point of view of the devotee (Bhakta), the Lord as the divine form of Krishna may be taken as the object of worship. In any way, the yogi who worships the Lord, the Absolute, is greater than those who worship the Devas. The purpose of all sadhana is to free the mind from impure tendencies binding it to the material world. In this process, devotion to the Lord is of primary importance.

It is to be noted that whatever the subject of the particular Discourse, the Lord does make a reference to devotion, to remind the seeker to have faith in Him and perform his work. Devotion thus forms the final note in this Discourse on Dhyana Yoga. God, the Absolute, should be worshipped with faith. The Gita emphasises faith in many places.

Indeed, very rare are those who could know him fully and without any doubt. Three conditions are prescribed. He should be attached to the Lord. He should consider the Lord as His sole refuge. He should practise yoga. The mind is like a powerful search-light. When it is turned aside, the objective world is seen; When it is turned inwards, the Self is seen. The mind thinks only of that to which it is attached. As the ignorant man is attached to the material world, his mind rambles continuously sense objects and is satisfied with sense-pleasures. Such a man cannot know the Lord- Paramatma. The wise man, turning away from the objective world, thinks of the Reality understands the Truth, and enjoys peace and bliss.

But alas ! How many are there who sorrow and weep for not having seen God ? very few indeed ! Verily, he who seeks Him, who weeps for Him, attains Him. A Disciple asked his teacher, “Sir, please tell me how I can see God.” “Come with me,” said the Guru, “and I shall show you.” He took the disciple to a lake, and both of them got into the water. Suddenly the teacher pressed the disciple’s head under the water. After a few moments he released him and the disciple raised his head and stood up. The Guru asked him, “How did you feel?” The disciple said, “Oh!

We can be perfectly doubtless only about one thing, and that is our own existence. When the knowledge is about the Self, no doubt is possible. It is One, non-dual and pure Consciousness. When one listens to the teaching from a perfect, authentic Master and absorbs it, the knowledge that is assimilated within will be such that no tinge of doubt will remain in him. And the knowledge will be samagram—complete, perfect. Completion or perfection is only in Consciousness, in the Chit, in the Self. Hence, only Self-knowledge can give us perfection. Any knowledge related to the world can never be perfect because it is ever-expanding in time, space and causation. It will never reach an end. Just as knowledge about objects and persons seen in a dream is illusory and can never be perfect, similarly, any knowledge about the world has no absolute reality. It is fascinating to note that in the first verse of this chapter, Bhagavan has used the word samagram, which means complete, perfect. Towards the end, in verse 29 , Bhagavan uses the word",

Sri Krishna ended the sixth chapter by describing the supreme yogi as one who, with his inmost self abiding in Him, adores the Lord. Though a man may know many or most of them, his knowledge is not complete. Even so, when the supreme Brahman is realised, all the experiences in the world are comprehended by that knowledge. Even so, Brahmajnana comprehends the knowledge of everything else. Here two words are used Jnana and Vijnana-Jnana means knowledge derived from the study of sastras. Vijnana means realisation of Atma i.e. The Lord declares that he will teach the truth, fully and completely. Vijnana may be taken to mean Knowledge of the Supreme Brahman. Every science is based upon this; all human knowledge is based upon the finding of unity in the midst of diversity; and if it is the task of small fragments of human knowledge, which we call our sciences, to find unity in the midst of a few different phenomena, the task becomes stupendous when the theme before us is to find unity in the midst of this marvellously diversified universe, where prevail unnumbered differences in name and form, in matter and spirit — each thought differing from every other thought, each form differing from every other form. Truth, bold truth, has been taught in bold language, and we need not fear to preach the truth in the same bold language today, and, by the grace of God, I hope at least to be one who dares to be that bold preacher. So you should check your knowledge, your devotion, and consult the scriptures to see whether they agree. He used to say, “If you get a tiny ray of light from the Divine Mother, it makes all learning pale into insignificance.” Sri Ramakrishna sounded like a drunkard when he talked to the Divine Mother, saying: “Do not give me the knowledge of Brahman, Mother! What can be greater than the knowledge of Brahman?” — Swami Turiyananda (Source: Ramakrishna as We Saw Him) She and He are One Swami Bhaskareswarananda Maharaj told me about his meeting Holy Mother Sri Sarada Devi as a young college student. Once Sri Ramakrishna asked Manindra Krishna Gupta: “What do you want?” “I want to express my ideas about the beauty of the world and human nature — that is my desire,” replied the young Manindra.

He wants to reveal everything to his disciple, make him understand the Supreme so that his mind shall not wander in ignorance at any time thereafter in the world. Lord Krishna teaches Arjuna the highest wisdom associated with personal and direct experience. There are several arts and sciences in the world. Though a man may know many or most of them, his knowledge is not complete. Something still remains to be known. But if the Lord is known, not merely by speculation or argument, but by direct experience, then man feels that there is nothing else to be known in the world.

That which is realized intuitively as Brahman, through the eliminating process of “not this, not this”, is then found to have become the universe and all its living beings. The vijñāni sees that the Reality which is nirguṇa, without attributes, is also saguṇa, with attributes. ‘A man cannot live on the roof for a long time. He comes down again. Those who realize Brahman in samādhi come down also and find that it is Brahman that has become the universe and its living beings. In the musical scale there are the notes, sā, re, ga, ma, pa, dha, and ni; but one cannot keep one’s voice on “ni” a long time. The ego does not vanish all together. The man coming down from samādhi perceives that it is Brahman that has become the ego, the universe, and all living beings. That is known as vijñāna. ’ Swami Vivekananda Says — It is true that the Upanishads have this one theme before them: कस्मिन्नु भगवो विज्ञाते सर्वमिदं विज्ञातं भवति। — “What is that knowing which we know everything else?” In modern language, the theme of the Upanishads is to find an",

Every science is based upon this; all human knowledge is based upon the finding of unity in the midst of diversity; and if it is the task of small fragments of human knowledge, which we call our sciences, to find unity in the midst of a few different phenomena, the task becomes stupendous when the theme before us is to find unity in the midst of this marvellously diversified universe, where prevail unnumbered differences in name and form, in matter and spirit — each thought differing from every other thought, each form differing from every other form. Yet, to harmonise these many planes and unending Lokas, in the midst of this infinite variety to find unity, is the theme of the Upanishads. On the other hand, the old idea of Arundhati Nyâya applies. To show a man the fine star Arundhati, one takes the big and brilliant nearest to it, upon which he is asked to fix his eyes first, and then it becomes quite easy to direct his sight to Arundhati.

God is first taught as some one who is the Creator of this universe, its Preserver, and unto whom everything goes at last. He is one to be worshipped, the Ruler, the Guide of nature, external and internal, yet appearing as if He were outside of nature and external. One step further, and we find the same teacher teaching that this God is not outside of nature, but immanent in nature. And at last both ideas are discarded, and whatever is real is He; there is no difference. तत्त्वमसि श्वेतकेतो — “Shvetaketu, That thou art.” That Immanent One is at last declared to be the same that is in the human soul. Here is no Compromise; here is no fear of others’ opinions. Truth, bold truth, has been taught in bold language, and we need not fear to preach the truth in the same bold language today, and, by the grace of God, I hope at least to be one who dares to be that bold preacher.

So you should check your knowledge, your devotion, and consult the scriptures to see whether they agree.

I came down and informed Maharaj that there was nobody there except a chair covered with a white cloth. Then Maharaj answered, ‘Oh! That is Holy Mother sitting covered with a white sari!’ So, I, again went upstairs and approaching the chair saw two toes of Holy Mother’s holy feet slightly uncovered.

Then how is it that you and Thakur are one?’ Holy Mother did not speak a word. Silently she pointed to the picture of Sri Ramakrishna in her shrine and then pointing to herself she raised her index finger indicated their oneness. That was enough to give me the conviction that Sri Ramakrishna and she are not separate, but are the all-pervading transcendental divinity appearing as two. When my mother came upstairs and offered her pranams, Holy Mother told her, ‘Shanti, you have three sons, you give me this boy.’ Immediately, my mother joyfully replied ‘I give this son to you.’ “After this, my mother began to prepare me to become a sannyasi of Ramakrishna Order.

A lover of wealth prays for money; a lover of name and fame prays for recognition; a lover of pleasure prays for enjoyment; a lover of aesthetics prays for beauty; a lover of the body prays for good health; a lover of knowledge prays for intellectual pursuits. Most people love God’s powers, but few love God. We do not realize that if we seek God, we will attain God as well as the wisdom and strength to handle worldly success. If, however, we seek only success and power, we may get them, but eventually they become sources of bondage. Once Sri Ramakrishna asked Manindra Krishna Gupta: “What do you want?” “I want to express my ideas about the beauty of the world and human nature — that is my desire,” replied the young Manindra. “That is fine,” said Sri Ramakrishna with a smile. “But if you realize God, you will achieve everything.” (Source: They Lived with God) Related Articles: The Lord said: To you, free from malice and cavil, I shall declare this profoundest secret, knowledge with experience combined",

Those who do not know this secret come under the power of the mind and dance to its tune.

The real sun shining in the sky is Atma, Pursha, the Lord. When the pot and water are destroyed, the sun is not at all affected by it. He shines in his own pristine glory. So the falling away of the body does not make any difference to Atma which is Eternal. Sankaracharya in the Viveka Chudamani explains this idea very clearly. The wise man leaves the pot,",

He takes refuge in Atma which is distinct from all these three, in the same way as the Sun in the sky is absolutely separate from that which is reflected in the water. All the changes pertain to the pot water and the reflection in it. The real Sun does not change. The pot may be big or small, the water pure or muddy. This does not affect the sun. So also the changes that take place in the body and mind of man does not affect Atma. The para and apara prakriti of the Lord undergoe all sorts of modification, but the Lord, Purusha, is not touched by them at all. The elements (apara prakriti) are insentient. According to the Advaitic concept, both the Prakritis are unreal. What is real is Atma. The seeker has to give up both the lower and higher Prakriti in order to reach Atma. Of course, the life element, the personality state, is superior to the gross insentient matter. But it",

Even so, when the mind is deluded by the three qualities, one cannot see Atma, who is transcendental. Enveloped by these qualities, man remains like a worm in a fruit. It can move inside the fruit, but it cannot come out unless the rind is broken. So long as the qualities agitate the mind, the real Self cannot be perceived. It is necessary first of all to understand the cause of ignorance and know that one is bound. Then only does he make the attempt to regain his freedom. The spiritual aspirant is on a higher plane because he has become conscious of his bondage and is eager to know the truth. This itself is a great step in evolution. The majority of people do not even know that they are slaves to their own lower nature. The aspirant is awakened to his present position as a bound soul, and so he strives to get himself free from the shackles that bind him. Except for the jivanmuktas, all the others – rich and poor, great and small, learned and illiterate – are bound",

When the ship sailed through the mouth of the Ganges into the ‘black waters’ of the ocean, the bird failed to notice the fact. When it finally became aware of the ocean, it left the mast and flew north in search of land. But it found no limit to the water and so returned. After resting a while it flew south. There too it found no limit to the water. Panting for breath the bird returned to the mast. Again, after resting a while, it flew east and then west.

    "text": "the ship. (Source: Tales and Parables of Sri Ramakrishna ) There was an ascetic, who worshipped God Ganesā. He had an idol of Ganesā, and another one of a rat, both made of gold. Both of theseweighed equally. Once the ascetic decided to go on a pilgrimage, He went to a goldsmith to sell them. The goldsmith weighed them and told the ascetic, that the value of each of the two was the same. At this the ascetic grew angry with the goldsmith and asked him how a vehicle could be equal, in value to the Lord. The goldsmith replied. “Sir, I am not buying either God Ganesā, or his vehicle, the rat. I buy gold. So I shall pay you according to their weight” ‘Thus, as a goldsmith does not notice Lord Ganesā or his vehicle, he sees only gold. So does a great soul behold God, he does not, see the world.

The point to note is that if there is faith in some form or other, such faith is strengthened by the Lord. This is the unique feature of the Hindu concept of God.

Whatever path one may follow, he has to come ultimately to the One Supreme Being. Since this universal vision is hard to acquire, men are given infinite choice to worship any form which appeals to their imagination, according to their past samskaras. The only condition is that there should be faith in the worship. Progress should be maintained whether the pace is slow or quick. And also, the destination should be kept in view, and there should be no deviation or back-sliding. Such men are blessed",

They had been visiting and were to take their leave that afternoon. She blessed them by placing her hands on their heads and then she asked them to take their seats. After a brief conversation, Surendra said to the Mother: “Mother, while worshipping the Master I find one difficulty. Suppose a devotee has a general belief that his Ishta-Devi [the chosen goddess] and the Master are one and the same. He worships the Ishta-Devi through the image of the Master. Afterwards he surrenders the fruits of his japa to the image of the Master, uttering the words, ‘O Maheshwari [the supreme goddess], through thy grace,’ and so forth.

The Master established a particular spiritual relationship with each devotee based on that person’s inner nature. He used to say, “I see vividly what is inside human beings, as one sees the items in a glass case.” A person can never act contrary to his or her nature, so the devotees were incapable of acting in a way inconsistent with the relationship adopted by the Master. If a man imitated another person, going against his own nature by doing so, the Master would be displeased and would point out that man’s mistake. For example, he used to call Girish “Bhairava” [a form of Shiva]. One day at the Dakshineswar Kali temple when he was in ecstasy, he saw Girish in that form. He put up with Girish’s importunities and harsh words because he could see the wonderful tenderness and complete dependence hidden under the veil of his rough mannerisms.

For the purpose of protecting the righteous and punishing the wicked, and establishing Dharma, He takes birth in this world. As Maya is under His control the power of adopting or discarding His form is in His own power. When the Lord thus incarnates Himself as a separate individual, His immortality is not at all affected. The separate form as Krishna or Rama is His own creation, and when the purpose of His Avatara is fulfilled, the form is dissolved and He remains the Eternal. The devotees are blessed by such Avataras. But unfortunately, the ignorant men of little intelligence consider the name and form of the Lord as His real nature, and so, they do not find Him different from other mortals. No doubt the devotees are endowed with faith and devotion when they see the manifestation of the Lord as Rama or Krishna. But they should Know the higher nature (Parambhavam) of the Lord, and should not get confused. Four attributes are mentioned about the higher nature of the Lord. (1) He is unknowable ( Avykta ).

The phenomenal world is visible to the senses and comprehensible by the mind. If the Lord also is a composition of the elements, he would dissolve like any other mortal form. But he is imperishable. He is subtler than any other. The material sky ( Akasa ) is itself invisible and so how can the Lord whose nature is more subtle ( Chidakasa ) be an object of perception? He is the whole universe, but he is at the same time not bound by physical laws because He is transcendental. Since He is beyond time and place, and is uncontaminated by material elements, since He is not subject to dissolution like other things, He is described as Supreme, most excellent (Anuttama). It should be clearly understood that this verse is not a disparagement of the worship of the different manifestations of the Lord in temples and images. The common devotee must go through this process of fixing some form of the Lord in the mind and worshipping Him in that manner. But he should not stop",

What is condemned here is to attribute mortality to the Lord and regard Him to be no more than a man. Sisupala could see Lord Krishna as a cowherd-boy and nothing more. It was Bhishma who could understand the transcendental nature of the Lord, while he appeared in the beautiful form of Krishna. Bhishma could worship the Lord as Krishna, and at the same time know that He is the imperishable Paramatma. Ravana could think of Sri Rama only as a mortal, subject to death like any other. But sages like Vasishta and others could understand that Sri Rama is the Lord Himself appearing as the Prince of Ayodhya. It is this understanding which is suggested in the verse for the guidance of all seekers.

He is veiled by his own power (Sakti), the cosmic illusion, and so He is not seen by all. To those for whom the veil is drawn off by intense discrimination, He becomes visible. Between man and God, there is the veil of cosmic illusion. It is Maya composed of the three qualities (Sattva, Rajas and Tamas). The veil of ‘Tamas’ is dark, that of Rajas is red, and that of Sattva is pure white. Thus the threefold veil covers up the effulgent Paramatma. As the devotee tears away veil after veil by intense sadhana, the Reality behind manifests itself as the final Truth. All the spiritual practices are intended to remove the obstruction that stands between man and God, and not to produce or create God! He is already there, the eternal conscious principle in all. The problem simply is to clear off the veil of Maya. The power of maya and how to cross over it has already been declared by the Lord (6-14). When a dark pot is placed over the lamp, light is not",

The word ‘ sarvasya ‘ (to all) here should refer only to the ignorant. That the Lord is veiled by maya is from the dualistic point only. Paramatma has no veil by which He is covered. He is unclouded pure Supreme Intelligence. The veil is for the individual Jiva only. The clouds cannot at any time affect the sun. He is always bright and glorious. The covering of the clouds is from the viewpoint of those who are below the clouds. The same is the case with the Supreme Lord.

It is deep and impenetrable darkness that shrouds the human being, preventing him from seeing the light of Atma. What is this delusion? It is the delusion of the pairs of opposites like pleasure and pain, heat and cold, etc., arising from desire and aversion. Freedom from attraction and revulsion (raga and dvesha) will eliminate the pairs of opposites. When there is no desire to enjoy a particular object, there cannot be any pain resulting from the non-possession of that object, nor the hatred against those who stand in the way of such enjoyment. Desire agitates the mind and makes it restless, and a restless mind is far away from peace which is the only condition for Self-realisation. Even if the desire is fulfiled, the desire itself will not die with its gratification. It seeks more and more enjoyment and there is no end to desires. So this subtle and powerful enemy should be fought with discrimination and dispassion and rooted out of the mind. Dislike towards an unpleasant object is common to all. The mind",

Thus the whole world is divided into two opposite extremes for the common man. So long as there is pleasure, there will be pain also. So long as there is joy there shall be unhappiness also. After very long experience, man discovers that he cannot have the one without the other, and his search for a painless pleasure is the fool’s search for the hare’s horn which does not exist. Then will he seek for that joy which is self-existent, which is the very Self of men. There he finds a bliss which is uncontaminated; there finds the light that has no shadow; there he finds the peace which nothing can disturb. This state must come to all sooner or later. The cosmic illusion overtakes man even from the time of birth. As man grows, the illusion takes a stronger hold on him.

Vows of silence, fasting, celibacy, study and others are practised by many for self-perfection. But to acquire steadfast discipline is difficult. The reason is that the mind is impure by accumulated sins of several births. This is the chief obstacle in spiritual life. As the dirty cloth cannot be dyed, as no seed grows in the wasteland, so also spiritual illumination does not arise in the heart of the sinful man. Sin is the manifestation of ‘rajo guna’ and this does not allow a man to remain still in the contemplation of the Self. The Mind is turned outward to wander in the wildness of the world. So the mind should be washed pure. And this is possible by performing good deeds, ‘ Do Punya karma and destroy sin ‘-that is the Lord’s command. The seeker should do good deeds continuously. Some charity, some service to suffering-humanity, some self-sacrifice for the sake of others, some japa and some kind of spiritual discipline should be done by him.

    "text": "Three questions are answered in this verse. First, what is Brahman? The Supreme and the imperishable is Brahman. Two attributes are mentioned here – supreme ( Paramam ) and imperishable ( Aksharam ). There is nothing other than or superior to Brahman. The One above and beyond which there is nothing else is Brahman. That is why it is described to be supreme Paramam. Brahman is imperishable, deathless. Since it is deathless it cannot be said to be born. The whole universe is constantly changing and going through the process of creation and dissolution in an endless chain. Birth and death is the law of nature, and there is only One that is birthless and deathless and that is Brahman. It is the seer (Drik), and so is indestructible. Destruction is only spoken of the seen (Drisya), and not of the seer (Drik). Brahman is indivisible, unaffected by time, space and causation. To the second question – ‘ What is Adhyatma? ‘- the answer given is nature (svabhava). One’s nature is svabhava (i.e.) the real Self of man, distinct from the superimposed body, mind, and senses.

So long as man identifies himself with the elements, which are subject to change and death, he cannot be happy. True happiness is only in the Self, pure, perfect, and imperishable. The third question is ‘What is Karma?’ The answer is ‘an act of sacrifice’, which is the cause of the birth of beings. This is yajna. By yajna, rains are produced and from rains, food, and from food all beings are born. The word ‘ Visarga ‘ here means that which is given away or that which is offered as a sacrifice to the Gods in the sacred Fire of the Yajna. In charity (Dana), wealth is sacrificed. Service to mankind in any form is an act of sacrifice. This also is Yajna, and it leads to Moksha. Commentary by Swami Chetanananda",

As one thinks so he becomes ( Yadbhavam tadbhavati ). This being the law, every thoughtful man should be extremely careful to choose and select only noble and spiritual thoughts to fill the mind. This should be practised throughout one’s life, so that they should be uppermost in the mind at the time of death.

Every man is himself responsible for his freedom or bondage. “If one thinks that he is free, free he is this moment.

The Lord has elevated ‘practice’ ( abhyasa ) to the state of the yoga, like Karma yoga, Jnana yoga etc. No other yoga can bear fruit without being supported by abhysa yoga. In the 6th Discourse , the Lord has already referred to practice (‘Abhyasa’) as the primary method of controlling the mind. In the practical field of work, we understand the need for systematic practice. In sport and art, practice is essential for perfection. In fact, practice is nothing else than the repetition of the mode of thought or act. Any act repeated many times becomes a habit. All the bad habits have been the accumulated effect of wrong practice. If practice is done in the right direction, good thoughts and acts become natural and spontaneous. When one comes across a person who is pure in thought, word and deed, he admires him, and sometimes wonders how he could be so pure. But he should realise how he had laid the foundations",

Whatever may be the yoga that the seeker chooses to follow, it should be first and last combined with abhyasa yoga. Then alone it would yield good results, just as purifying powders work on the human body only when they are mixed with water. 2. The second thing is that the man should not move away from the ideal. The aim is Atma, and the mind should therefore be centered in the Atma, and not allowed to move out towards material objects. Whatever appears (‘anatma’) perishes. Knowing this, through discrimination one should hold fast to Atma alone. As the mind by its nature can only hold on to some form it should be given some divine object or form to which it can easily cling to. So it is said here that one should meditate on the Supreme Divine Lord ( Paramam Purusham Divyam ).",

The Supreme has no end as no words can fully describe it, so the Lord gives the very essence of the Vedas and the worship of the Supreme as the simple single syllable OM-Pranava. The Vedas declare that Brahman alone is Eternal. Everything else is transitory and changing. It is this Reality that man has to understand and realise. Knowledge of all other things cannot confer the bliss of immortality. In Hinduism, every child when he starts his education begins with the sacred word OM, which is Brahman. So whatever else a man may learn and understand, he should not neglect the knowledge of the Imperishable Brahman. The knowers of Vedas, after a great deal of thought, have arrived at the highest goal Brahman, and thus attained absolute peace and bliss. Who can enter this state? This question is also answered here. Only those who are free from attachment and desire, free from lust and hatred, can enter the Brahmi State. Let no man complain that he cannot attain that state. The key to this consummation is in his hands. It is purity. Let the mind be purged of all",

    "text": "The easy way to attain God is here explained. People think that it is very difficult to attain Him. But practising in the right way, He is easily attained. He who thinks of him continuously and always attains Him. The mind should be free from any other thought except the thought of God. Usually, the mind is attached to various things and gets entangled in the meshes of the objective world through the senses. That is why it is said here that one should be filled to the brim with the thought of God continuously and forever. It is not enough to think of Him now and then. Always and every day the thought of God should be present in the mind. Of course, by steady practice day after day, the mind could be trained to think of God more and more. So practising, after a long time, the mind gets fixed and does not turn away from Him. Then the Lord is attained. The seeker should be vigilant and try his best not to yield to the temptations of Maya. The wakeful and watchful man has no fear of falling away from the goal. Commentary by Swami Chetanananda Sri",

Is there such great need of your saying over and over again, ‘O God, You have created the sky, the great oceans, the lunar world, the solar world, and the stellar world’? “Everybody is wonder-struck at the mere sight of a rich man’s garden house. People become speechless at the sight of the trees, the flowers, the ponds, the drawing-room, the pictures. But alas, how few are they who seek the owner of all these! Only one or two inquire after him. He who seeks God with a longing heart can see Him, talk to Him as I am talking to you. Believe my words when I say that God can be seen. But ah! To whom am I saying these words? Who will believe me? “Can one find God in the sacred books? By reading the scriptures one may feel at the most that God exists.

Through His grace you will see Him and He will talk to you.” SUB-JUDGE: “Sir, does God show more grace to one than to another? If so, He can be accused of the fault of partiality.” MASTER: “What are you saying? Do you mean to say that the moon and a glow-worm are the same, though both give light?

When the truth is known there is no birth, and hence no pain or sorrow. The need for perfect freedom is stated here. Freedom is to be attained for the purpose of transcending pain and sorrow. The Lord makes it clear that the place where man takes birth is the abode of sorrow and is non-eternal. Birth is subject to those two evils. Even if a person feels that he is enjoying something here it is only a shadowy joy, which is mixed with pain. We see that joy is inevitably followed by sorrow as its own shadow. That is why wise men are not tempted by these reflected pleasures. The world is the abode of sorrow. It is the place where sorrow rules. Out of ignorance and delusion, man imagines that he is enjoying this or that pleasure.

So the way to transcend is to attain God. Let everyone take refuge in God in every way, through devotion, knowledge, and dispassion. Union with God is the highest state of freedom and perfection. As many enlightened sages have attained that state, it is suggested that every man can achieve it with adequate will and discrimination. Those who take refuge in God with a pure heart are mahatmas. Those who are entangled in worldly objects are ‘alpatmas,’ – little-minded men. Mahatma is a title. To reject the false and hold on to Truth, to reject the ephemeral and hold on to the Eternal, to reject anatma and hold on to Atma, is the way to attain the highest state of Mahatma. Such enlightened sages do not return to the world which is characterised by pain and sorrow. Those who are desirous of eternal joy should strive with faith and devotion to reach that state.

They are all in the realm of the phenomenal the difference being in their gross or less gross nature. So those who reach the subtler worlds like Svargaloka or Brahmaloka have to return again. They come and go in the same way as this world. But those who have attained Paramatma have no re-birth. This is Moksha. The reason is that all the worlds up to Brahmaloka are objective and so they repeat themselves endlessly. Only Atma which is the ‘Drik’ is not subject to the modifications of time and place.

Here the Lord gives an estimate of the duration of day and night of Brahma (Creator) and thereby suggests that even Brahma is limited by time. The day of Brahma is thousand yugas and night another thousand yugas. So one complete day and night for Brahma endures two thousand Mahayugas. The following table shows the duration in years: Kaliyuga 432000 years Dvaparayuga 864000 years (Twice Kaliyuga) Tretayuga 1296000 years (Thrice Kaliyuga) Kritayuga or Satyayuga 1728000 years (Four times Kaliyuga) Total 4320000 (1 Mahayuga) One thousand such Mahayugas make a day, and another one thousand such Mahayugas make a night for Brahma. Three hundred and sixty-five such days make a year, and one hundred such years constitute the life-time of Brahma. What one should understand is that even this astronomical duration of life of Brahma is limited by time. The sage is not interested in anything by time, and the transitory pleasures derived by living in such worlds. He aspires to go beyond time, to realise the immeasurable Paramatma.

As he is bound by his own desires, he is not free. Therefore man should strive for freedom. He has already passed through millions of births. By some good fortune, he has acquired a human birth. Without wasting it in useless pursuits, he should strive for liberation. Commentary by Swami Chetanananda",

    "text": "In the previous verse , the nature of the unmanifested (Prakriti) was explained. Here it is declared that there exists another unmanifested, the Eternal, (Paramatma) which is not destroyed when all beings are destroyed. The distinction between Paramatma and all other beings born of Prakriti is explained below. Beings Paramatma 1. Subject to Maya. 1. Lord of Maya. 2. Of little separate forms 2. Cosmic Intelligence, all-pervading and all-sustaining. 3. Drisya – Visible to the senses 3. Drik – the Witness. 4. Having a beginning. 4. No beginning and no end. 5. Subject to death. 5. Imperishable. From this, we understand why we should worship the Lord. All that is non-eternal can only hold on to the eternal as its last refuge and support. So leaving all non-external things of pleasure and profit in this transitory and sorrowful world, man should meditate on the ever-glorious and imperishable Self. By such meditation, the death-stricken Jiva acquires immortality by union with That which does not perish. Commentary by Swami Chetanananda",

There is no samsara again for the sage who attains the highest goal. Having lived in the world, it becomes clear that everything is vanishing like a dream. The child of today is the old man of tomorrow. Pleasures turn into pains. Joys lead to sorrow. Life ends in death. The whole scheme of existence is only a troubled dream. Time passes and death takes away all. Knowing this fully from experience the wise man is not at all interested in this child’s play. He has no relish for these insipid things. He knows that the dream life is utterly unbecoming of him, who has the eternal Self as his real Being. So he aims high, aims at Truth, aims at the lion rather than catch a jackal.

After Totāpuri left Dakshineswar the Master determined to return to the nirvikalpa plane. He did so, and as a matter of fact, remained in that state, more or less, for six months. It is a puzzling period of his life, in one sense, since he was cared for not by Hriday or other relatives, nor by Mathur, nor the Brāhmaṇī (all of whom were, apparently, still at Dakshineswar), but by an unknown wandering sādhu, a sojourner at the temple garden. This monk somehow knew that this body, with its matted hair, flies entering mouth and nose, looking more dead than alive, needed to be preserved for the world. Sometimes he would beat that body with a short stick, when, finding a little external consciousness, he would force food into the Master’s mouth. ‘I was,’ says Ramakrishna, ‘in that state from which",

Then after six months I heard the Mother’s command, “Remain in bhāvamukha for the spiritual enlightenment of men.”16 Twice before, he had heard this command (see Chap. II). Swami Saradananda devotes many pages to the explanation of this term. As we have said, it is a name for the general condition of a mystic’s mind which enables him on the one hand to experience the visions and ecstasies of the personal forms of God; and on the other, to leave the relative behind and plunge into the Absolute. This was to be Sri Ramakrishna’s condition for many years following. As already mentioned (in the Introduction) a devotee who saw him in 1874 testifies to his absorption in samādhi continuously for three days and nights. The Master said on many occasions, ‘The natural tendency of the mind is upwards, towards the nirvikalpa plane. Once in samādhi it does not feel inclined to come down. For your sake it has to be forced down. Even this is not motive enough, so I catch hold of trifling desires, and",

As the rope is the basis, Paramatma is the basis, the foundation, the reality of all this illusion. Where is the dream world? It is in man and nowhere else. So also, all this world is in Paramatma. Like the cream, in milk, Paramatma pervades the whole of creation. Unswerving devotion to the Lord is the only way to attain Him. Intense devotion and one-pointed concentration are essential for Realisation. Dispassion, vairagya, towards the whole of the objective universe, and faith in the Lord as the only refuge-this is intense (ananya) bhakti. The perfect does not think of anything else.

The bright state comes only to the knowers of Brahman and not to others. The word ‘ Janah ‘ shows that the realisation of Brahman is open to all without any distinction of caste, sex, religion or race. Since Brahmajnana is light, five light-causing things are mentioned here. (1) Fire, (2) Light, (3) Day, (4) The bright fortnight, (5) The northern solstice (Uttarayana). The fifth points the way to the higher worlds of light and knowledge. The Jiva should find his abode in the light of Brahmajnana, the imperishable Self. So he moves upwards into light and not downwards into darkness. The upward look (urdhvadrishti) is absorption in the light of Atma, and the downward look (adhodrishti) is in the contemplation of the insentient material – world. Thus the light-producing things are an indication of knowledge and the ascent of man towards Self-realisation. From this state, there is no return.

It is also necessary to understand the significance of Uttarayana and Dakshinayana. We find that many great souls have passed away in Dakshinayana and many deluded souls have passed away in Uttarayana. If the external meaning alone is taken, it would lead to the absurd conclusion that the ignorant attain the Light and the wise fall into darkness. The wise always take the upward path of light, whatever may be the time when the body falls. The deluded take the path of darkness, whatever may be the time when the body falls.

Man becomes that which he aims at, the time taken depending on the intensity of the effort, and the strength of the obstructing forces. Sooner or later, it is certain that man achieves what he yearns for with single-minded devotion. The Lord declares here that without faith no one could attain Him, and without attaining Him no one can get immortality. Let the seekers understand that much diligence is needed even in small things and common affairs of life. This being so, one can understand what care and caution are needed to realise the highest state. So, the Lord emphasises the efficacy of faith throughout His teaching. According to the Lord, this Samsara is a world of death. Death is stalking everywhere and yet blinded by the veil of avidya, man imagines that life is beautiful and pleasant. He has missed the true end of life. He has bartered away his birthright of immortality and eternal bliss to a mess of pottage. The Lord knows this, and out of compassion, he warns",

He said to Rama: ‘O Rama, sometimes I think that You are the whole and I am a part of You. Sometimes I think that You are the Master and I am Your servant. And sometimes, Rama, when I contemplate the Absolute, I see that I am You and You are I.’ “Yasoda became grief-stricken at being separated from Krishna, and called on Radha. Radha saw Yasoda’s suffering and revealed herself to her as the divine Sakti, which was her real nature. She said to Yasoda: ‘Krishna is Chidatma, Absolute Consciousness, and I am Chitsakti, the Primal Power. Ask a boon of Me.’ Yasoda said: ‘I don’t want",

Please grant me only this; that I may see the form of Gopala in my meditation; that I may always have the company of Krishna’s devotees; that I may always serve the devotees of God; that I may always chant God’s name and glories.’ “Once the gopis felt a great desire to see the forms of the Lord. So Krishna asked them to dive into the water of the Jamuna. No sooner did they dive into the water than they all arrived at Vaikuntha. There they saw the form of the Lord endowed with His six celestial splendours. But they did not like it. They said to Krishna: ‘We want to see Gopala and serve Him. Please grant us that boon alone. We don’t want anything else.’ “Before His departure for Mathura, Krishna wanted to give the Knowledge of Brahman to the gopis. He said to them: ‘I dwell both inside and outside all beings. Why should you see only one form of Mine?’ (Source: Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna ) Related Articles: All beings are unmanifest in their beginning, O Bhārata, manifest in their middle state, and unmanifest again in their end.

So it is said to exist in, and sustained by Paramatma. From the Advaitic plane, the world does not exist at all, in the same manner as water does not exist in the mirage. So it is said here that the beings also do not exist in Him. This is from the pure Advaitic point of view, where there is only one undifferentiated eternal Brahman, and nothing else. The Lord’s declaration means that Drisya the seen world does not exist in Him, or He in Drisya.

One day the ladies of Balaram Babu’s family were sitting before the Master in his room when a prostitute named Ramani passed along the road nearby. The Master called to her and asked, “Why don’t you come nowadays?” The ladies were scandalized to hear the Master talking with a prostitute. Shortly afterwards the Master took them to visit the shrines. When they reached the Kali temple the Master said to the Divine Mother: “Mother, Thou indeed hast become the prostitute Ramani. Thou hast become both the prostitute and the chaste woman!” The ladies understood that they were wrong in despising Ramani, and that the Master spoke with her, knowing her to be the Mother Herself. They should not be so proud of their chastity, for it was all due to the Mother’s will. — Sri Ramakrishna (Source: Ramakrishna as We Saw Him)",

They worship the Lord with unswerving minds, because they identify the Lord with two great attributes. (1) The Lord is the final cause of all beings. (2) He is imperishable. These two attributes are not to be found in any other thing or person. The Lord is the Ancient, beyond birth and death, and universal. Thus the great souls distinguish the Lord from all other material or superficial things. They are able to see clearly how everything is going through a process of change, whereas the eternal Lord remains changeless. Therefore their mind is ever contemplating the Lord with unswerving devotion.",

They think, sing and speak of the Lord’s glory always. Such adoration comes through constant striving. The striving is not intermittent but continuous. They are steadfast in vows. The Lord emphasises firmness many times. The mind is saturated with powerful past samskaras, impurities of raga and dvesha, acquired through several births. They cannot be eliminated except by firmness and steadfast striving. The seeker has to practice certain vows to purify the body and mind (fasting, silence, japa, dhyana, brahmacharya). These vows should be followed with cheerfulness, courage and determination. Otherwise, progress on the spiritual path is obstructed and the seekers are drawn away from the goal by the force of ignorance (avidya). Firm vows are strong weapons with which avidya could be defeated and overcome. Nitya yuktah: They are always attached to the Lord, with devotion. Their worship is illumined by devotion. It is noteworthy how the Lord emphasises devotion to Him at every step. It is merely intellectual understanding but deep emotional realisation which leads to the Lord.

If we extend the analogy, we will find that every force, small or great, is nothing but the manifestation of the Lord.

A combination of hydrogen and oxygen produces cool water; and the same hydrogen and oxygen are used in the oxy-hydrogen blowpipe. “In that state both activity and non-activity are possible; that is to say, one then performs unselfish action. “Worldly people, who are engrossed in sense-objects, say that everything exists — asti . But the mayavadis, the illusionists, say that nothing exists — nasti . The experience of a Buddha is beyond both ‘existence’ and ‘non-existence’.” MASTER: “This ‘existence’ and ‘non-existence’ are attributes of Prakriti. The Reality is beyond both.” The devotees remained silent a few moments. (Source: Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna ) —– MASTER ( to M. and the others ): “Is it an easy thing to obtain the Knowledge of Brahman? It is not possible unless the mind is annihilated.

( to himself ): “Assimilation!” MASTER: “A man attains Brahmajnana as soon as his mind is annihilated. With the annihilation of the mind dies the ego, which says ‘I’, ‘I’. One also attains the Knowledge of Brahman by following the path of devotion. One also attains It by following the path of knowledge, that is to say, discrimination. The jnanis discriminate, saying, ‘Neti, neti’, that is, ‘All this is illusory, like a dream.’ They analyse the world through the process of ‘Not this, not this’; it is maya. When the world vanishes, only the jivas, that is to say, so many egos, remain. “Each ego may be likened to a pot. Suppose there are ten pots filled with water, and the sun is reflected in them.

He had long lived with and served the Master and had often sent him into ecstasy by singing devotional songs. He was, therefore, dearly loved by the Order of Ramakrishna.

Nor can we say that it is real. For just see how this garden has changed. Formerly it was a graveyard, and this Kuthi, the house of a European. But now! And some days after, this temple also will vanish, and who knows what will come next ?’ – Swami Premananda (Source: Spiritual Talks by the First Disciples of Sri Ramakrishna) The very idea ‘I am the body’ is itself a misapprehension. It is the sole cause of birth, death, decay, disease… all of it. Hence the only way to be free of these is to be free of the body-identity; that can happen only through the right knowledge.

    "text": "Some devotees worship, not the formless Brahmam but other Gods with name and form. If their devotion is sincere, they in a sense, worship the supreme who is the foundation for all Devas. This form of worship is the wrong method. They are not worshipping the Supreme directly. So there is a difference in the fruits of merit. The various Devas may confer different rewards of health and wealth, children and prosperity in worldly life, but the worship of the Supreme confers the highest reward of Moksha (liberation). Whatever may be the object of worship, faith is essential. With such faith, if the Lord is worshipped the devotee obtains liberation. Bhagavad Gita 9.23 to 9.25 by Swami Chetanananda Swami Vivekananda Says — Later on we read what Krishna says, “Even those who worship other deities are really worshipping me.” It is God incarnate whom man is worshipping. Would God be angry if you called Him by the wrong name? He would be no God at all! Can’t you understand that whatever a man has in his own heart is God — even if he worships a stone? What of that!

At one place the author found peace of mind only after compelling Bhagavati, the Divine Mother, to take Her initiation according to the Vaishnava discipline. “Once I spoke highly of Vaishnavcharan to Mathur and persuaded him to invite Vaishnavcharan to his house. Mathur welcomed him with great courtesy. He fed his guest from silver plates. Then do you know what happened? Vaishnav said in front of Mathur, ‘You will achieve nothing whatsoever in spiritual life unless you accept Krishna as your Ideal.’ Mathur was a follower of the Sakta cult and a worshipper of the Divine Mother. At once his face became crimson. I nudged Vaishnavcharan. “I understand that the Bhagavata also contains some statements like that. I hear that it is said there that trying to cross the ocean of the world without accepting Krishna as the Ideal Deity is like trying to cross a great sea by holding to the tail of a dog. Each sect magnifies its own view. “The Saktas, too, try to belittle the Vaishnavas.",

Therefore She has engaged that fellow Krishna for the purpose.’ ( All laugh .) “Besides, how vain people are about their own sects! There are weavers in the villages near Kamarpukur. Many of them are Vaishnavas and like to talk big. They say: ‘Which Vishnu does he worship? The Preserver? Oh, we wouldn’t touch him!’ Or: ‘Which Siva are you talking about? We accept the Atmarama Siva.’ Or again, ‘Please explain to us which Hari you worship.’ They spin their yarn and indulge in talk like that. “Rati’s mother, Rani Katyayani’s favourite confidante, is a follower of Vaishnavcharan.

(Source: God Lived with Them) Here is the narration of the profound story of Yogi Vemana, which illustrates his lifelong philosophy that purity of heart outweighs social status. Yogi Vemana – The Wandering Mystic Yogi Vemana, the great Telugu philosopher and poet, was a Parivrajaka —a wandering ascetic. He traveled from village to village, naked or clad only in a loincloth, challenging the rigid caste systems, empty rituals, and the hypocrisy of the wealthy. One scorching afternoon, Vemana arrived in a small, bustling village. As news of the great saint’s arrival spread, the villagers gathered. Among them were the wealthy landlords, learned scholars, and priests, all eager to earn merit ( Punya ) by feeding the holy man. The Feast of Pride A wealthy merchant, dressed in fine silks, pushed his way to the front. He held a silver plate filled with exotic delicacies—sweet rice, ghee-laden curries, and fruits. He bowed, not out of humility, but to show the crowd his capacity to offer such a feast. “Swami,” the merchant said,",

It is the finest food in the village, prepared by the highest caste cooks in a ritualistically pure kitchen.” Vemana looked at the silver plate, then at the merchant. With a dismissive wave of his hand, he refused. “Take it away,” Vemana said abruptly. “This food smells of filth.” The crowd gasped. The merchant was insulted. “Filth? Swami, this is pure vegetarian food served on silver! How can it be filthy?” Vemana remained silent, closing his eyes, refusing to engage with the man’s ego. Other wealthy villagers tried to offer him food, but he rejected them all, sensing the arrogance and desire for social validation behind their charity. The Offering of Love Standing at the very edge of the crowd was an elderly beggar woman. She belonged to the so-called “untouchable” caste. She was dressed in rags, holding an old, chipped clay pot. Inside, she had a small amount of Ambali (a simple, watery ragi gruel) that she had begged for herself that morning. She watched the rejection of the rich with fear. She thought, “If the Swami rejects the feasts of kings, surely he will spit on my poor",

Vemana opened his eyes and looked straight at her. His face broke into a gentle smile. He extended his cupped hands toward her. “Mother,” he called out gently. “I am very hungry. will you not feed me?” The crowd was horrified. The woman trembled. “Swami, I… I am of low birth. This is just leftover gruel in a dirty pot.” “Give it to me,” Vemana insisted. With shaking hands, she poured the gruel into his hands. Vemana drank it with immense relish, licking his fingers as if he had just tasted the nectar of the heavens. The Lesson The rich merchant, unable to contain his anger, shouted, “Swami! You rejected my pure food on a silver plate, calling it filth, yet you eat the leftovers of an untouchable beggar from a clay pot? What kind of madness is this?” Vemana stood up, his eyes blazing with the wisdom of a Yogi . “Your food was cooked in a ‘pure’ kitchen, but it was served with a heart full of",

She gave me the food that was meant for her own survival. She gave it not for fame, but because her heart cried for my hunger. Her pot may be made of clay, but her heart is made of gold. Food served with affection is nectar; food served with pride is poison. “ The Essence The villagers stood in silence, humbled. Vemana had once again taught them that in the eyes of the Divine, the vessel does not matter—only the contents of the heart do. This incident is often summarized by the essence of Vemana’s poetry ( Vemana Padyalu ): “Metuku vendi paatra mida unna phalamemi? Manasu niluva leni manishi kante… Bhakthi leni puuja patri chetu…” (Meaning: What is the use of a grain of rice on a silver plate if the mind is not steady? Worship without devotion is a waste.)",

Such a man who practices renunciation of the fruit of action (Karmaphalatyaga) is freed from all the bonds of Karma. The term Moksha is frequently used by all people. What does it mean? Where is the Moksha? Here is the meaning of it. Freedom from bondage is Moksha. What is this bondage: The bondage of karma done by men with a sense of personal doership and desire for its fruits. To give up the fruits of karma to God is Moksha. It is Sanyasa. From the point of view of self-realisation, both good and evil are in the realm of the unreal. But the seeker has to release himself from evil first and then give up good also. Then he reaches the Nirvikalpa state. This is the surest way to liberation and union with the Lord.

Let me wait on him properly.” After Amzad had finished his meal, Holy Mother cleaned the place where he had sat with her own hands. Nalini shrieked: “Aunt, you have lost your caste!” “Keep quiet,” the Mother scolded her. Then she added: “As Sharat is my son, exactly so is Amzad.” Sharat was a direct disciple of Ramakrishna, the secretary of the Ramakrishna Mission, and a monk endowed with saintly virtues; Amzad was a Muslim and a convicted robber. Thus Holy Mother demonstrated that she is the Mother of the good and the bad. She also showed that kind treatment can enkindle faith in the heart of a weak, lowly man and prove to him that he is a son of the Divine Mother. Her example brought to life the words of Krishna: “I am the same towards all beings; to Me there is none hateful or dear.

    "text": "The effect of the right decision is declared here. The wicked man quickly becomes a righteous man (‘Dharmatma’), and attains eternal peace. This point should be carefully understood because all progress in spiritual life depends on correct and firm decision. One may read all the sastras in the world and yet cling desperately to the ephemeral things of the world. Such a man has not come to the right decision in spite of his learning and erudition. The decision that Paramatma alone is Real, and that He alone is the ultimate refuge should be reached. But doubt and darkness cover up the mind, and the truth, though repeatedly heard, does not sink into the mind and illumine the heart. But, when the correct decision is reached, accepted, and confirmed by one’s own heart, he immediately becomes a righteous man, whatever his former sins might be. Not only does he become righteous, but he enjoys supreme eternal peace. The Upanishads declare “Unto them comes peace and to none else.” The second line of the verse is the Lord’s proclamation to the world. “My devotee never perishes.” This is a ‘ mahamantra ‘ for all mankind.

No one need feel disheartened on account of the low birth, if he has developed true devotion to the Lord. Caste and creed are of no concern at all for anyone to attain Brahmajnana. This open secret is free for all. Women also are qualified for Brahma Vidya. The universality of the Gita is thus proclaimed to the whole world. The all-inclusive and all-embracing character of the Gita distinguishes it from other sectarian scriptures which deny the right of liberation to certain section of people on account of race, or creed or religion. Merit is the only consideration. All other artificial barriers between man and man are shattered once and for all by the teaching of the Gita. Purity of mind is the real test of jnana.",

As the Master finds the disciple in a receptive mood, full of faith and diligence, he reveals more of the Royal Secret out of the fulness of His heart.

Again (Bhuyah) the Lord repeats and emphasises His universality and the hearer understands it, thinks of it and meditates on it.

Even they are not able to understand the infinite mystery of the Lord. Endowed with wisdom, if these great souls fail to know the Lord fully, what to speak of other mortals? No one can measure the infinitude of the Lord with his finite mind. So, what man can aspire for, is simply to surrender to Him, and obtain His grace, by which he merges in and becomes one with him.

    "text": "Among living beings of the world, man is the highest incarnation and among mortals, he who knows the Lord as unborn and beginningless is the greatest. Paramatma is unborn ( ajah ) and He has no beginning ( anadi ). All other beings have a beginning and end. They are born in time and die in time. Knowledge of Paramatma alone confers immortality on man. He becomes free from delusion. This indeed is the highest reward which man can get by his devotion to the Lord. All other worldly benefits are impermanent and illusory. They lead to sorrow and death. So it is the primary duty of all seekers to hold on to the Lord and transcend delusion with His grace. When delusion is gone, man is at once freed from all sin. When man becomes sinless he becomes one with Paramatma. Though a man is burdened with all the sins in the world, yet, like fire burning up a vast forest, God’s grace destroys the entire sin. So, devotion to the Lord is what is most essential. And his devotion is cultivated, strengthened, and developed by understanding the infinite Glory of the Lord. As man thinks constantly of the",

Commentary by Swami Chetanananda Sri Ramakrishna Says — A DEVOTEE: “Sir, is there no help, then, for such a worldly person?” MASTER: “Certainly there is. From time to time he should live in the company of holy men, and from time to time go into solitude to meditate on God. Furthermore, he should practise discrimination and pray to God, ‘Give me faith and devotion.’ Once a person has faith he has achieved everything. There is nothing greater than faith. (To Kedar) “You must have heard about the tremendous power of faith. It is said in the Purana that Rama, who was God Himself — the embodiment of Absolute Brahman — had to build a bridge to cross the sea to Ceylon. But Hanuman, trusting in Rama’s name, cleared the sea in one jump and reached the other side. He had no need of a bridge. (All laugh.) “Once a man was about to cross the sea. Bibhishana wrote Rama’s name on a leaf, tied it in a corner of the man’s wearing-cloth, and said to him: ‘Don’t be afraid. Have faith and walk on",

He opened it and found only a leaf with the name of Rama written on it. ‘What is this?’ he thought. ‘Just the name of Rama!’ As soon as doubt entered his mind he sank under the water. “If a man has faith in God, then even if he has committed the most heinous sins — such as killing a cow, a brahmin, or a woman — he will certainly be saved through his faith. Let him only say to God, ‘O Lord,! will not repeat such an action’, and he need not be afraid of anything.” ( BG 10.3 , BG 4.36 , BG 9.32 , BG 18.66 ) When he had said this, the Master sang: If only I can pass away repeating Durga’s name, How canst Thou then, O Blessed One, Withhold from me deliverance, Wretched though I may be?

So if one should be asked to declare his ancestry, let him say boldly that he is the child of the great Rishis and Manus. If anybody thinks he is low-born, he degenerates into a vile man. If he thinks that he is pure and perfect, he does become the real child of the ancient Masters. Therefore, may all beings remember their holy fore-fathers every day, and by acquiring their great qualities, break the shackles of bondage and enjoy perfect peace and joy. Among the above-mentioned, the Devarshis (Sanaka Sanandana, Sanatkumara, Sanatsujata) taught the path of the withdrawal from worldly life ( Nivrithimarga ). The fourteen Manus taught the path of Dharma, righteous conduct of life ( Pravrittimarga ). The first belongs to the line of the Gurus, and the second to the line of the ancestors. All these are brought forth from the Supreme Being, by a wish (samkalpa) of His mind. So ultimately all are the children of the Lord and He is the father of all.

Pure devotion is therefore the result of real understanding of the creative power of the Lord and His wonderful manifestation. Without understanding how the Lord is present in the universe, it is difficult to cultivate true faith, and without faith pure devotion is not possible. When man knows that the Lord is the final cause of everything, and that there is nothing else but He in all things, he spontaneously offers worship to Him. Such an act of devotion and surrender will be deep-felt, sincere and true. The devotee’s surrender is deep, firm, unalterable and unconditional, for the very reason that he knows the real presence of the Lord in everything and all that takes place in the universe. This thought ( ‘bhava’ ) of the devotee is like the shell in the cannon. Mere powder without the shell can only produce smoke and fire, but the target cannot be shattered.

His mind thinks of the Lord; his limbs do the work of the Lord; his eyes see the Lord; his reason understands the presence of the Lord everywhere. His whole life is thus absorbed in the Lord. His whole life is a continued worship. When the devotees meet together they only talk of God, His power, and Yoga. God’s glory is infinite. Everywhere, in everything, God’s power is manifesting itself. So the devotee goes on thinking and speaking of God’s Glory. Such holy company is the highest spiritual education that man can get. All doubts are cleared by mutual enlightenment. There is a powerful current, spiritual thought, and emotion, circulating among them. The very air they breathe is full of knowledge and bliss.

Life is nothing if God is not realised. We find great idealists giving up everything for attaining their ideal. So also the believers in God are ready to give up their life in their effort to reach Him. Lukewarm-faith does not lead to the goal quickly. The sacrifice should be complete and unconditional. Then the Lord is pleased, and immortality is attained. That is why it is said “tyagennike amritatvamanasuh.” – by sacrifice alone, immoratality is obtained. Great souls surrender their all to the Lord. This verse gives a vivid picture of the daily life and work of the devotee dedicated to the realisation of the Supreme.

Knowledge derived through Buddhiyoga is compared to a lamp that dispels darkness as soon as it is lighted. The light of knowledge thus shatters all darkness of ignorance. One may do everything – Japa, Tapa, Pranayama, or Karma – and yet ignorance cannot be removed except by the flash of intuitional knowledge of Self. All other practices are intended to purify the mind and render it capable of perceiving the Truth (Brahman). They are means of Self-purification.

The Lord knows wealth, power, position and children, are not eternal reward. They pass away in time. So He wishes to bestow on them the everlasting gift of Brahmajnana. We understand from this that no one can reach that state without God’s grace, and that God’s grace is to be attained by pure and perfect devotion to the Lord. Knowledge derived through Buddhiyoga is compared to a lamp that dispels darkness as soon as it is lighted. The light of knowledge thus shatters all darkness of ignorance. Nothing else but light can dispel darkness. One may struggle with darkness eternally with all his weapons, and yet it will not go, till by striking a match he brings in light. Such also is ignorance. One may do everything – Japa, Tapa, Pranayama, or Karma – and yet ignorance cannot be removed except by the flash of intuitional knowledge of Self. All other practices are intended to purify the mind and render it capable of perceiving the Truth (Brahman). They are means of Self-purification. Who causes",

In spite of his illness, Swami Turiyananda was always ready to speak about God and spiritual life. A brahmacharin once asked, “Maharaj, what is a good subject for meditation?” “Any subject that appeals to you,” the swami replied. “All lead to the same goal.” Then he explained the relationship between the guru and the disciple: “The guru should hold the disciple through love. He should not bind him, but give him full freedom. His aim should be to dispel delusion, to clear the vision… . The disciple should obey through love, not from fear. That would be slavery.” (Source: God Lived with Them) Bhagavad Gita:",

That is why the Lord declares only the most excellent in which the seeker could easily discover the Lord’s presence. In fact, there is not a particle of matter or energy or intelligence or virtue which is not a manifestation of the Lord. This universality of outlook and inner understanding is the highest form of devotion. Bhagavad Gita 10.19 to 10.20 by Swami Chetanananda Sri Ramakrishna Says — MASTER ( to the devotees ): “To lean against a bolster!” (Rich and aristocratic persons seeking comfort generally sit in this fashion.) You see, it is very difficult to give up vanity. You may discriminate, saying that the ego is nothing at all; but still it comes, nobody knows from where. A goat’s legs jerk for a few moments even after its head has been cut off. Or perhaps you are frightened in a dream; you shake off sleep and are wide awake, but still you feel your heart palpitating. Egotism is exactly like that. You may drive it away, but still it appears from somewhere. Then you look",

No one can do anything without this Power. But you must remember that there is not an equal manifestation of God’s Power in all things.

Hazra once asked me, ‘When will you think of God if you are always anxious about these boys?’ ( Keshab and the others smile .) That worried me greatly. I prayed to the Divine Mother: ‘Mother, see what a fix I am in! Hazra scolds me because I worry about these young men.’ Afterwards I asked Bholanath about it. He said to me that such a state of mind is described in the Mahabharata . How else will a man established in samadhi occupy his mind in the phenomenal world, after coming down from samadhi? That is why he seeks the company of devotees endowed with sattva. I gave a sigh of relief when Bholanath told me of the Mahabharata . “Hazra is not to blame. During the period of struggle one should follow the method of discrimination — ‘Not this, not this’ — and direct the whole mind to God. But the state of perfection is quite different.

    "text": "Seven virtues among women are mentioned by the Lord. Where these virtues are, whether in men or women, all are qualified for the highest realisation. Women are not weak; they have also in them the Divinity that lifts them up to the plane of spiritual realisation. The point to note is that where these qualities are found, there the Lord is. The second line of the verse is interpreted in another way. Prasuti, the daughter of Svayambhuva Manu, married Dakshaprajapati, and to them were born twenty-four daughters. Among them there are Kirti Devi, Medha Devi, Dhriti Devi, Smriti Devi and Kshama Devi. Sri Devi is the daughter of Bhrigu. Vagdevi is the daughter of Brahma (creator). These seven are the presiding Deities of the seven virtues. The Lord here declares that He is all these seven feminine virtues. Whatever the interpretation maybe it is clear that the functioning of these virtues is due to the Lord Himself. This verse is an inspiring call to women to give up all superstitious notions about their weakness or lowness, and stand up to realise what is their birth-right along with men and Gods.

(4) It is stated in the Ramayana, that Margasirsha is the ornament of the year. (5) The Bhagavad Gita was proclaimed to Arjuna in the month of Margasirsha (Suddha ekadasi) on the 11th day of the bright fortnight. (6) Dattatreya was born in the same month (Suddha Purnima). (7) The atmosphere is pleasant and equable and so the month is most suitable for tapas and Sadhana (Spiritual practice).",

It is all a manifestation of that Atman; He is being manifested in everything; only, when the manifestation is very thick we call it evil; and when it is very thin, we call it good. It is the Atman, the Soul, in the saint and the sinner, in the happy and the miserable, in the beautiful and the ugly, in men and in animals; it is the same throughout. In some It is expressed more, in others less, but this difference of expression has no effect upon the Atman. The very fact that the external force can somehow evoke the internal force shows that somewhere they join each other — they must be continuous and, therefore, basically the same force.

All talents, all faculties, all arts and sciences, all intelligence, order, discipline, all that is admirable, grand, great and splendid, are the manifestations of the Lord’s glory. Let no man imagine that he has anything to be proud of. If he has prosperity, that prosperity is the Lord’s; if he has power and intelligence, all that is the Lord’s; if he has genius that genius is the Lord’s. He who thinks that they are his own possessions is guilty of misappropriating the Lord’s plenty, and should suffer the penalty of loss and bereavement. These great attributes of the Lord should be contemplated continuously, so that they may become part and parcel of one’s own nature and lead him to union with the Lord. Swami Vivekananda Says — Whatever is pleasure and happiness and light in the universe belongs to Purusha; but it is a compound, because it is Purusha plus Prakriti. “Wherever there is any happiness, wherever there is any bliss, there is a spark of that immortality which is God.”",

He did not demand it as a right, in the manner of a person who claims it as a reward of his devotion. Such humility is needed for every disciple in the presence of the Guru. He should leave it to the teacher to give him any experience which he thinks fit for the disciple. The disciple does not know what he is, what his powers are, and what he is fit for. The teacher knows it. So Arjuna appeals to the Lord to show him the Cosmic Form if the Lord thinks that he is fit to see it. Moreover, in the previous verse , Arjuna has declared his complete faith in the words of the Lord. He believes every word of the Lord when He described His infinite Glory. So faith and humility are the only means to win the Lord’s Grace. Commentary by Swami Chetanananda Bhagavad Gita: Chapter 11 🔻 (55 Verses) 01 02 03 04 05",

So here, the Lord asks Arjuna to behold the whole universe standing like one of the limbs in the body. One can only imagine the infinity of the Lord. Nay, it is beyond all imagination, to whatever extent it may be stretched by human effort. Physical space is indeed unimaginably large; larger should be the mindspace; larger still should be ‘Chidākāśa’. In this infinity (Atma) the whole universe (Jagat) is like a spot. The Lord of infinite forms, all-pervading, all-powerful, is no other than Paramatma who is the ruler of all the worlds (Sarva loka mahesvaram). Knowing Him as such, it is man’s duty to worship Him with faith, devotion, and humility. Verily, there is no cause for man to feel proud of his little wealth or power or position. What are man’s wealth and powers? What is man after all in the scheme of this universe? What after all is this earth where man glorifies himself by building a small state or empire? Man’s egoism and pride for his so-called achievements is sheer delusion (Avidya).",

The limitations of the human eye and the gross delusions to which it is subject every moment, it within the experience of every thoughtful man. That the human eye is grossly erroneous in its perceptions can be seen from very simple facts. Sitting in the railway carriage, the eye sees the objects around moving with terrific speed. It sees the stationery sun crossing the sky from east to west. It sees the moon running behind the rushing clouds. All these show that the naked eye cannot be trusted to give us a correct picture of anything in the world. In fact, the eye is the most powerful cause of delusion for man. So, the Lord here says that Arjuna cannot see the Cosmic-Form by himself with his own eyes. “ Drisyate tvagraya buddhya sukshamaya sukshmadarsibhih. ” Paramatma is seen by the subtle concentrated intellect of the Seers. So say the Upanishads. Though the Lord is everywhere, man is not able to see Him because ignorance covers the eye. This is the evil of Māyā; this is the darkness or ignorance. When the",

As the blind man cannot see the sun, so also the eye of the ignorant cannot see the all-pervading Self. It is utter nonsense to say that God does not exist because He is not seen by the eye of flesh. The argument would be as convincing as the blind man’s denial of the existence of the sun. How then can man attain the divine eye to see the Lord? Assuredly, by the grace of the Lord, by His love, by His compassion. “ Dadami te chakshuh “, says the Lord (I give to you the divine eye). To whom does he give the divine eye? To those who are devoted to Him. ( Tesham satatayuktanam dadami buddhiyogam 10.10 ). The same idea is emphasised here. Repeatedly does the Lord inculcate the idea of surrender to Him in a spirit of devotion and humility. “Worship Me,” He says, “in every possible way; take refuge in Me; surrender to Me; I will give you knowledge, peace and bliss”.

In the course of spiritual discipline one gets a ‘love body’, endowed with ‘love eves’, ‘love ears’, and so on. One sees God with those ‘love eyes’. One hears the voice of God with those ‘love ears’. One even gets a sexual organ made of love.” At these words M. burst out laughing.

Please show me that.’ ‘Father,’ replied Parvati, ‘if you seek the Knowledge of Brahman, then renounce the world and live in the company of holy men.’ But King Himalaya insisted. Thereupon Parvati revealed Her Brahman-form, and immediately the king fell down unconscious. (Source: Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna ) —– MASTER (to Ram and the other devotees): “Devotees like Rakhal, Narendra, and Bhavanath may be called nityasiddha. Their spiritual consciousness has been awake since their very birth. They assume human bodies only to impart spiritual illumination to others. “There is another class of devotees, known as kripasiddha, that is to say, those on whom the grace of God descends all of a sudden and who at once attain His vision and Knowledge. Such people may be likened to a room that has been dark a thousand years, which, when a lamp is brought into it, becomes light immediately, not little by little. “Those who lead a householder’s life should practise spiritual discipline; they should pray eagerly to God in solitude. (To Mr. Choudhury) God cannot be realised",

He said: ‘How astonishing! God Himself is the companion of the Pandava brothers, and still there is no end to their troubles and sorrows!’ Who can ever understand the ways of God? “A man thinks, ‘I have practised a little prayer and austerity; so I have gained a victory over others.’ But victory and defeat lie with God.

God with form is as real as God without form. Do you know what describing God as being formless only is like? It is like a man’s playing only a monotone on his flute, though it has seven holes. But on the same instrument another man plays different melodies. Likewise, in how many ways the believers in a Personal God enjoy Him! They enjoy Him through many different attitudes: the serene attitude, the attitude of a servant, a friend, a mother, a husband, or a lover. “You see, the thing is somehow or other to get into the Lake of the Nectar of Immortality. Suppose one person gets into It by propitiating the Deity with hymns and worship, and you are pushed into It. The result will be the same. Both of you will certainly become immortal. “I give the Brahmos the illustration of water and ice. Satchidananda is like an endless expanse of water. The water of the great ocean in cold",

The rishis had the vision of the supersensuous Spirit-form and talked with It. But devotees acquire a ‘love body’, and with its help they see the Spirit-form of the Absolute ( BG 11.8 ). ( Mundaka Upanishad 2.2.11 ) “It is also said in the Vedas that Brahman is beyond mind and words. The heat of the sun of Knowledge melts the ice-like form of the Personal God. On attaining the Knowledge of Brahman and communing with It in nirvikalpa samadhi, one realises Brahman, the Infinite, without form or shape and beyond mind and words. (Source: Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna ) It is by God’s grace alone, not self effort, that human beings can have the vision of God.

Fearlessness, courage, spirit of action, these are taught in the Gita as the main doctrines of life. Having surrendered everything to the Lord, having understood that He is the real actor in this wonderful drama of life, why should man fear, when he is working as a mere instrument in the hands of God? Self-surrender and righteous action cannot have the seeds of fear in them. Therefore the Lord exhorts Arjuna to carry out his duty without any fear. In daily life, man is caught in fearful circumstances, and confronted with formidable obstacles. Everyone knows this. In such moments, if the Lord’s exhortation is remembered, man is inspired with a higher power which will enable him to overcome all the obstacles in the way. No one should give up his duty out of fear. “ Yudhyasva ” (fight) that is what the Lord wants everyone to do, according to his status in life. The duties of life are prescribed for all, and each man has to perform them without fear or cowardice. The word",

Thus, if a man surrenders himself to the Lord, and fights the battle of life righteously, he is sure to obtain victory. Where Sri Krishna is, there is victory. Though Bhishma and others are still alive, the Lord declares them to be ‘already dead’ ( hatah ). What does this mean? In the 26th and 27th verses , the secret has been revealed. The Lord is Time, not time as we see it divided into past, present and future, but Eternity in which there cannot be any of these divisions manufactured by the limited mind of man. The past, present and future are one in Eternal Time. So the future of man is easily foreseeable by the divine vision. So the enemy warriors are dead already, killed by the Lord, in the Cosmic aspect of Time. Man should learn a great lesson from this. He will find that what he is considering worthy and pleasant, all the relations and friends, all the treasures and loves and hatreds, are already dead and gone, though appearing to live. Death then loses its power over the wise man who regards",

Why then weep and wail for the loss of this or that? Time takes away all. Nay, it is all taken away already. Thus knowing, the wise man is not deluded. Renunciation (Vairagya) comes to him spontaneously. Lord Buddha thought of this inevitable sequence of human life, and was inspired to find out that, which does not die in the midst of death? That question comes to all at one time or other. The answer also comes in due course. The Self of man is man beyond death. Realising the Self-Atma, man is freed from the shadow of death. He acquires immortality in the world.

The man of science is discovering infinitesimal fragments of His Divine power. The more powerful telescopes reveal more and more of the immeasurable star-worlds on all sides. The more powerful microscopes reveal infinitesimally smaller and smaller beings everywhere. So the Lord is greater than the greatest, larger than the largest, smaller than the smallest. What is man before the Divine! Man’s attempt to know God’s power is just like an ant’s attempt to fathom the depth of the ocean! Man can use a fan for a whiff of breeze; God can cause a tempest! Man can light a lamp to illumine a room, God can send forth the Sun to illumine the earth and sky! Man can dig a well for water, God can plunge the world in a deluge, making miles around vast sheets of water! Man can shoot a rocket into space! God can shoot stars and planets into space.

This being so, how can there be anything equal or greater than the Lord? He is the final refuge for all beings.

Can a man get pearls by floating or swimming on the surface? He must dive deep. “One must get instruction from a guru. Once a man was looking for a stone image of Siva. Someone said to him: “Go to a certain river. There you will find a tree. Near it is a whirlpool. Dive into the water there, and you will find the image of Siva.’ So I say that one must get instruction from a teacher.” ISHAN: “That is true, sir.” MASTER: “It is Satchidananda that",

The guru should be regarded as the direct manifestation of God. Only then can the disciple have faith in the mantra given by the guru. Once a man has faith he achieves all. The sudra Ekalavya learnt archery in the forest before a clay image of Drona. He worshipped the image as the living Drona; that by itself enabled him to attain mastery in archery. “Don’t mix intimately with brahmin pundits. Their only concern is to earn money. I have seen brahmin priests reciting the Chandi while performing in the swastyayana. It is hard to tell whether they are reading the sacred book or something else. They turn half the pages without reading them. (All laugh.) “A nail-knife suffices to kill oneself. One needs sword and shield to kill others. That is the purpose of the sastras. “One doesn’t really need to study the different scriptures.

    "text": "A question arises in this verse. When Arjuna says, “ tenaiva rupena chaturbhujena ,” it is implied that he has seen this delightful form before? If so, when did he see this form? It appears from his imploring the Lord to forgive him for any word or act of disrespect to Him, that he has not formerly realised the Divinity of the Lord, but regarded him as a friend and relation. This contradiction can be reconciled in the following way. (1) Before the Lord revealed His Cosmic-Form, He should have shown the four-armed form of Vishnu. In the 50th verse , it is said that the Lord appeared again in His normal form, ( bhuyah svakam rupam darsyamasa ), and also that the Lord appeared in His gentle form ( punah saumyavapur mahatma ). Thus we come to know that the Lord had shown the four-armed form of Vishnu just before he assumed the Visvarupa. (2) Arjuna might have heard that when the Lord was born to Devaki, He appeared in the form of Vishnu with Discus, Conch and Crown etc. 3) By seeing the Cosmic-Form, Arjuna realises that he is no other than the Supreme Lord Vishnu who rules",

Bhagavad Gita 11.47 to 11.49 by Swami Chetanananda Swami Vivekananda Says — He who believes not, believes not even after seeing, and thinks that it is all hallucination, or dream and so on. The great transfiguration of Krishna — the Vishvarupa (form universal) — was seen alike by Duryodhana and by Arjuna. But only Arjuna believed, while Duryodhana took it to be magic! Unless He makes us understand, nothing can be stated or understood. Somebody comes to the fullest faith even without seeing or hearing, while somebody else remains plunged in doubt even after witnessing with his own eyes various extraordinary powers for twelve years! The secret of it all is His grace! But then one must persevere, so that the grace may be received. [Source]",

    "text": "The same idea as in the 48th verse is emphasised here. Good in themselves, these practices like Vedic study, charity, etc., do not yield the highest reward of God-realisation without devotion (Bhakti). Latu’s ( Swami Adbhutananda ) lack of formal education made him unique among Sri Ramakrishna’s direct disciples. Perhaps because his mind was uncluttered by intellectualism and not trained to doubt, he absorbed the instructions of his guru with unquestioning simplicity. Once the Master told him in an ecstatic mood, “One day the gems of the Vedas and Vedanta will pour forth from your lips.” Thus Latu was commissioned and blessed by his teacher. This prophecy later came to be fulfilled to the letter. It would seem as though Sri Ramakrishna intended to demonstrate to the modern world through Latu that God can be realized without the study of books and scriptures, that spiritual wisdom comes not through intellectualism but through inner realization.

It is here declared categorically that by single-minded devotion only the Lord could be known, seen, and attained. Ananya bhakti’ is emphasised in several places in the Gita. The mind should not be attached to anything in the objective world; it should be centred in the Lord as the sole refuge, as the most beloved and as the highest goal. Devotion that is not shared, that is not tempted away from God, that does not desire anything other than God, is single-minded devotion. Man’s mind is generally possessed by worldly things and only a part of it is offered to the Lord. This is not ‘ananya bhakti’. When the mind is not distracted by anything material, it acquires divine power and thus attains the Lord. Three stages of God-realisation are mentioned here: (1) Jnatum to be known, (2) drashtum to be seen, (3) praveshtum-to be",

At this stage, the Lord, though his nature is understood, is quite far away. This is Dwaita. Then in the next stage, the devotee is able to see the Lord face to face, have a clear vision of God in whatever form he contemplates Him. Now there is no doubt at all about His existence, because he has directly seen the Deity. The second step is higher than the first. God is seen like a leaf or fruit in one’s own hand. This is nearly the state of Visishtadvaita. After long and arduous practice the devotee becomes united with the Lord (Praveshtum).

When there is fear of anything, it is not perfection. So every aspirant should strive to attain the Lord (Praveshtum) and free himself from fear. If Vedic study alone could lead to God-realisation, the illiterate shall have to go without it. If austerity alone should lead to God-realisation the weak shall have no hope; If ‘yajnas’ and ‘Dana’ alone could lead to God, the poor shall have to be where they are. As it is declared by the Lord that by single-minded devotion alone he could be realised, every human being can aspire for God-realisation by pure and uncontaminated devotion. Thus out of His compassion, the Lord has revealed the easy path of God-realisation to all beings.

    "text": "evam: (‘thus’): This word refers to the last verse (matkarmakrit etc.) in the previous Discourse. Arjuna’s question is simple and clear. Who are superior – those who worship the Divine form, as the Cosmic Manifestation, or the four-armed Vishnu, or the cowherd boy of Brindavan (sagunopasaka) – or those who meditate on the formless, attributeless Brahman (nirgunopasaka)? In the 2nd Discourse the Lord has declared the deathless and birthless reality of Atma, and in the 8th Discourse, he has explained the Nirguna aspect as Imperishable Brahman. It is quite natural for Arjuna to question the Lord about the superior excellence of either of the two. Arjuna’s question is the question of all seekers in the world – which is the better method of worship – Saguna or Nirguna? Bhagavad Gita 12.1 to 12.2 by Swami Chetanananda The next Sunday we left for Dakshineswar early in the morning. During that day’s visit I said to Sri Ramakrishna: “Some people say that God is formless; others say He has form; and still others call Him Krishna, Shiva, or Kali. Could you tell us what the real nature of God is?” Sri Ramakrishna smiled and said: “He is sometimes with form; He is",

Just as there is nothing to compare gold with except gold, so there is nothing equal to God. He is the cause of the gross objects as well as of the subtle mind and intellect. For example: The same substance in its solid form is ice; in its liquid form is water; and in its gaseous form is vapour. God manifests Himself according to the mental attitude of the spiritual aspirant. A jnani experiences God as all-pervading, formless space, and a devotee perceives God with a particular form. So if you sincerely want to know the real nature of God, meditate on Him in solitude. Have patience. Surrender yourself to Him and pray. When the right time comes you will see Him.” I then said, “We enjoy peace when we feel the presence of God in our hearts; otherwise mere intellectual understanding of God and atheism are the same.” Sri Ramakrishna then replied: “In the beginning one should move forward on the spiritual path holding to an initial faith [i.e., faith in the words of the scriptures and the guru].

The Lord declares that who-so-ever worships Him with supreme faith and single-minded concentration, he is the best of yogis. Three aspects of spiritual practice are mentioned here. Establishing the mind in the Lord, ever thinking of Him, having firm faith in God. Whoever possesses these three qualities is the best of yogis. Whether he is a Saguna or Nirguna worshipper or whether he is a sannyasi or house-holder-these distinctions have no significance at all. The Lord’s amazing insight into spiritual Truth is revealed here. Devotion, faith, and concentrated effort-these are emphasised as the final determining factors in spiritual life and not the path or method of worship. Sri Ramakrishna Says — “Dive deep; one does not get the precious gems by merely floating on the surface. God is without form, no doubt; but He also has form. By meditating on God with form one speedily acquires devotion; then one can meditate on the formless God. It is like throwing a letter away, after learning its contents, and then setting out to follow its instructions.” (Source: Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna ) —– The Master said to the",

It is devotion tinged with intellectual knowledge. It makes one feel: ‘Krishna has become all these. He alone is the Supreme Brahman. He is Rama, Siva, and Sakti.’ But this element of knowledge is not present in ecstatic love of God. Once Hanuman came to Dwaraka and wanted to see Sita and Rama. Krishna said to Rukmini, His queen, ‘You had better assume the form of Sita; otherwise there will be no escape from the hands of Hanuman.'(Because Rama and Sita were Hanuman’s Chosen Ideals.) “Once the Pandava brothers performed the Rajasuya sacrifice. All the kings placed Yudhisthira on the royal throne and bowed low before him in homage. But Bibhishana, the King of Ceylon, said, ‘I bow down to Narayana and to none else.’ At these words the Lord Krishna bowed down to Yudhisthira.

Yasoda used to think: ‘Who would look after Gopala if I did not? He will fall ill if I do not serve Him.’ She did not look on Krishna as God. The other element is ‘my-ness’. It means to look on God as one’s own —’ my Gopala’. Uddhava said to Yasoda: ‘Mother, your Krishna is God Himself.

Whatever may be the method of worship, if it is practised with faith and devotion, man reaches Paramatma. These two verses deal with persons who seek Nirguna Para Brahmam. This first verse states the attributes of the Imperishable Brahman and the second the qualities necessary for the aspirant for such realisation. Even though the seeker carries on his meditation on the formless Brahman, yet, if he does not possess purity of mind, self-restraint, equanimity, and love for all beings, his effort does not yield the desired results. Without these qualities of good character, realisation of Brahman is impossible. His worship will be like depositing good and relishing eatables in an impure vessel. All of them become corrupt and contaminated by the impurities of the vessel. Both the paths of realisation require the above qualities of character. Therefore the Lord mentions the three indispensable qualities of the aspirant in this context. Complete self-restraint, Equal-mindedness, Universal love. The seekers should cultivate these three qualities well while carrying on their method of worship. Here the word ‘Samniyamya’",

The Master noticed, however, that Keshab and Vijay rather shrank from each other, and he was anxious to reconcile them. MASTER ( to Keshab ): “Look here. There is Vijay. Your quarrel seems like the fight between Siva and Rama. Siva was Rama’s guru. Though they fought with each other, yet they soon came to terms.

But what benefits the one benefits the other. In like manner, you have a religious society, and Vijay thinks he must have one too. ( Laughter .) But I think all these are necessary. While Sri Krishna, Himself God Incarnate, played with the gopis at Vrindavan, trouble-makers like Jatila and Kutila appeared on the scene. You may ask why. The answer is that the play does not develop without trouble-makers. ( All laugh .) There is no fun without Jatila and Kutila.

Therefore let the seekers be not in a hurry to reach the unmanifest even at the start.

The Pure Mind is the same as the Pure Atman. “Once a wicked man beat into unconsciousness a monk who lived in a monastery. …… M: “Isn’t it possible to develop both jnana and bhakti by the practice of spiritual discipline?” MASTER: “Through the path of bhakti a man may attain them both. If it is necessary, God gives him the Knowledge of Brahman. But a highly qualified aspirant may develop both jnana and bhakti at the same time. Therefore it is good to have the feeling, ‘I’ am the servant of God, His son, His devotee.’ “For the Kaliyuga the path of bhakti is especially good.

For them the Lord’s words : “To those whose minds are set on Me, verily I become ere long, O son of Prithâ, the saviour out of the ocean of the mortal Samsâra (world)”; for “the goal of the Unmanifested is very hard for the embodied to reach.” The knowledge of Brahman is difficult for him who has not got over the consciousness of mind and body. But then, because the knowledge of Brahman is beyond the reach of such, it is not that they should become hopeless. Is what Râmprasâd says different from the knowledge of Brahman—seeing God in everything, everywhere, in every action, and in every being ? That is why Prahlâda, the great devotee, says, “That deathless love which the ignorant have for the fleeting objects of the senses—as I keep meditating on Thee—may not that sort of intense love for Thee, slip away from my heart.” If one gets such love for Him there is no more delay for God-realisation—He even comes out of the pillar to manifest Himself to His devotee. The more one loves Him, the more He manifests Himself in one’s heart. He is minuter than the minutest and greater than the greatest.’ He resides in the heart of man as consciousness. The Master used to say, ‘The pure mind and the Self are one.’ That mind in which there are no mentations or desires, cannot be called mind. Then there exists only an all-pervading consciousness, power, or Brahman-whatever you may call it. If one be not constantly engaged in selfless work, study of scriptures, worship, Japa, and meditation, it is not possible to comprehend the truth of Vedanta.",

Everything is a question of love. The more one loves Him, the more He manifests Himself in one’s heart. He is the friend of the sincere and pure. He is ever in our hearts, but we fail to see Him because our eyes are directed to other objects ; but for this there would have been no delay in realising",

Ours is mere talk, we do not want Him from our hearts. Such is the power of Maya that we fail to see the Truth. So the Lord, out of His grace, has shown us the way out also. “Those who are absolutely resigned to Me, easily cross over this Maya of Mine.” “Surrender to Me”—there is no other way out. May the Lord out of His infinite grace hold our minds on to His feet—let this be our one prayer. — Swami Turiyananda (Source: Religion and it’s Practice by Disciples of Sri Ramakrishna) Swami Shivananda: “If you meditate on God with form, He Himself will reveal to you His real nature. There is something beyond form. This (what we see) is gross. Beyond this is the subtle, and then comes the causal, and so on. It is very difficult to meditate on the formless.

But then one has to start with some form. There is no question of inferiority or superiority in this-it is a question of temperament. Whatever appeals to one is the best for him. Form melts into the formless and again the formless takes a form. God is both with form and with-out form, and again beyond both. It is not possible to know Him with this mind. He can be comprehended only by the pure mind. The Master used to say, ‘The pure mind and the Self are one.’ That mind in which there are no mentations or desires, cannot be called mind. Then there exists only an all-pervading consciousness, power, or Brahman-whatever you may call it. That again takes form according to the temperament of the devotee. All this is hard to comprehend. If one be not constantly engaged in selfless work, study of scriptures, worship, Japa, and meditation, it is not possible to comprehend the truth of Vedanta. If there is His grace, these things",

The first lesson is fixing the mind firmly in Him. It is not enough to fix the mind only, the intellect also should be placed in Him. Why? The intellect is the deciding power, and without its direction, the mind wavers and wanders away from the goal. The mind thinks and reason decides. It is reason (‘buddhi’) which takes the final decision that the Lord alone is real and all else is like water in a mirage. By the very power of this decision, the mind becomes one-pointed and is then established in God. If the mind wavers, it is because the intellect has not decided right. So the Lord here says that the intellect should be placed in Him. Then meditation becomes deep and firm. Man then lives in God. Like salt dissolving in water, the mind becomes that which it contemplates. Thinking of the Lord, by giving up all the evil qualities arising from ignorance and past samskaras is Moksha.

That is, all work should be done in a spirit of self-surrender to God. Bad actions are not included here, because they are already prohibited by the Sastras. No one should do sinful acts. Worship of God, singing His name and glory, charity, works of social welfare, all these are good actions and they should be surrendered to God. (Isvararpanam, Ramarpanam, or Krishnarpanam) . As several paths are suggested, each man may take up any practice suitable to his physical and mental predisposition. This last path is within the reach of all persons. While walking, let it be thought of as pradakshinam of God. While talking let it be thought of as singing His glory. This may be extended to all actions.

But when he comes into practical life, there is always the danger of its being contaminated by worldly objects. But for the man who has surrendered all actions to God, the mind is always pure. The ‘Tyagi’ enjoys purity everywhere and at all times. Therefore it is said here that ‘tyaga’ is higher than ‘Dhyana’. From this, we understand the superior excellence of ‘Nishkama Karma’. Most people are engaged in work. Very few can renounce work completely. So for the majority of mankind, this path is most suitable and leads them to a higher realisation than ‘jnana’ and ‘dhyana’.",

If this is practised for long, the foundation of spiritual life would be firm and steady. The higher realisation can be had only after this purity is perfected in the mind and heart. Tyagat santiranantaram: Peace is the immediate reward of self-surrender to God. Renunciation of the ego, renunciation of the objective world, renunciation of sin and evil – this is immediately followed by peace. The impurities of the mind being cleansed, peace flows into it like a flood (tesham santih saswati netaresham) . Atma shines forth in the pure heart. Everyone in the sorrowful world is seeking for peace. How to get it? “tyagat santih” – from renunciation, peace is obtained. Therefore one should give up all sensual pleasures, fruits of actions, egoism and the binding sense of doership. Then he shall experience the highest peace.

The path to reach the goal is sadhana, practice. The Gita expounds more on the practical side of sadhana than the goal to be attained. So it is known as a practical guide to self-realisation. In the Second Discourse, the Lord has explained the nature and state of the man of steady wisdom (Sthitaprajna). Here the nature and qualities of the devotee are stated. In the following Discourse, He declares the qualities of the Jnani. The Daivisampath is explained, starting with ‘ abhayam ‘ fearlessness.

Therefore, along with natural flowers, it is necessary to worship the Lord with flowers of virtue and spiritual conduct. May all the seekers learn His higher form of worship and obtain God’s grace. Of all worldly things, the greatest and the most precious possession of man is the Lord’s love, and such love cannot be attained except by the practice of the above-mentioned virtues.

But as he evolves he offers the flower of his own mind to the Divinity pervading the whole universe. Sankaracharya in his Sivanandalahari says that people have not yet learned to offer the flower of their mind to the Lord and then remain in blissful quietude. Thus the real devotee evolves towards the higher form of worship with the mind. What are these flowers of the mind? They are the thirty-five virtues mentioned here. Non-injury, self-restraint, universal love, forgiveness, peace, austerity, meditation, and truthfulness are most dear to Lord Vishnu. Therefore, along with natural flowers, it is necessary to worship the Lord with flowers of virtue and spiritual conduct. May all the seekers learn His higher form of worship and obtain God’s grace. Of all worldly things, the greatest and the most precious possession of man is the Lord’s love, and such love cannot be attained except by the practice of the above-mentioned virtues. Those whose conduct is hostile to Divine Command and the injunctions of the ‘Sastras’ cannot hope to receive God’s grace. It is self-delusion for",

The moral and spiritual qualities needed for Self-realisation are stated as Knowledge (Jnanam) here. Without perfect command of these qualities, no one can attain Paramatma. Thus when the mind is purified by spiritual qualities, the Self is clearly reflected in it. So the seeker has to cultivate these qualities of jnanam first, and the self-existent Paramatman is revealed spontaneously without any effort on the part of man. The Realisation of Paramatman occurs by itself. Knowledge of Atma is attained by their grace.

It is not speculation or logic or argument, but actual perception of Atma, which is Brahmajnana. What is not jnana is ignorance. Pride and arrogance, selfishness, envy and jealousy, ill-will, hatred and a host of evil passions, desires, hopes and fears which beset the mind constitue ignorance. When you see these things arriving, you conclude that the master will very soon come.” A DEVOTEE: “Sir, should one first practise discrimination to attain self-control?” MASTER: “That is also a path. Thus you will destroy lust, anger, the desire for creature comforts, and so on.” DEVOTEE: “How can I take delight in God’s name?” MASTER: “Pray to God with a yearning heart that you may take delight in His name.",

When there is no birth, there is no body; when there is no body there is no old age or disease or death. That is why both birth and death are said to form the cycle of ‘samsara’. The man who desires to escape death, should also avoid birth. One cannot be had without the other. The true aspirant thinks deeply and sees clearly ( anudarsanam ) all the evils arising from material life. By such contemplation, he develops a deep inspiration to transcend these evils by every means possible. He finds ultimately that he is not the body, but Atma, the unborn and deathless, free from all the modifications of body and mind. Thus he transcends death. This habit of the mind to see the evils of life and death is of utmost importance in the path of knowledge. asaktir anabhishvangah putradaragrihadishu: The house-holders should think of this aspect of jnana.

So intense is one’s love of God that one becomes unconscious of outer things. Chaitanya had this ecstatic love; he ‘took a wood for the sacred grove of Vrindavan and the ocean for the dark waters of the Jamuna’. Second, one has no feeling of ‘my-ness’ toward the body, which is so dear to man. One wholly gets rid of the feeling that the body is the soul. “There are certain signs of God-realisation. The man in whom longing for God manifests its glories is not far from attaining Him. What are the glories of that longing? They are discrimination, dispassion, compassion for living beings, serving holy men, loving their company, chanting the name and glories of God, telling the truth, and the like. When you see those signs of longing in an aspirant, you can rightly say that for him the vision of God is not far to seek. “The state of a servant’s house will tell you unmistakably whether his master has decided to visit it.

When there is no birth, there is no body; when there is no body there is no old age or disease or death. That is why both birth and death are said to form the cycle of ‘samsara’. The man who desires to escape death, should also avoid birth. One cannot be had without the other. The true aspirant thinks deeply and sees clearly ( anudarsanam ) all the evils arising from material life. By such contemplation, he develops a deep inspiration to transcend these evils by every means possible. He finds ultimately that he is not the body, but Atma, the unborn and deathless, free from all the modifications of body and mind. Thus he transcends death.

When there is no birth, there is no body; when there is no body there is no old age or disease or death. That is why both birth and death are said to form the cycle of ‘samsara’. The man who desires to escape death, should also avoid birth. One cannot be had without the other. The true aspirant thinks deeply and sees clearly ( anudarsanam ) all the evils arising from material life. By such contemplation, he develops a deep inspiration to transcend these evils by every means possible. He finds ultimately that he is not the body, but Atma, the unborn and deathless, free from all the modifications of body and mind. Thus he transcends death. This habit of the mind to see the evils of life and death is of utmost importance in the path of knowledge. asaktir anabhishvangah putradaragrihadishu: The house-holders should think of this aspect of jnana.

Ritualistic devotion consists in repeating the name of God and performing worship in a prescribed manner. It is like crossing a rice-field in a roundabout way along the balk. Again, it is like reaching a near-by village by boat in a roundabout way along a winding river. “One does not follow the injunctions of ceremonial worship when one develops raga-bhakti, when one loves God as one’s own. Then it is like crossing a rice-field after the harvest. You don’t have to walk along the balk. You can go straight across the field in any direction. “When the country is flooded deep with water, one doesn’t have to follow the winding river. Then the fields are deep under water.

However hard you may rub a grain of gold against a grindstone, still a bit of it always remains. Or again, take the case of a big fire; the ego is like one of its sparks. In samadhi I lose outer consciousness completely; but God generally keeps a little trace of ego in me for the enjoyment of divine communion. Enjoyment is possible only when ‘I’ and ‘you’ remain. “Again, sometimes God effaces even that trace of ‘I’. Then one experiences jada samadhi or nirvikalpa samadhi. That experience cannot be described. A salt doll went to measure the depth of the ocean, but before it had gone far into the water it melted away. It became entirely one with the water of the ocean.

So intense is one’s love of God that one becomes unconscious of outer things. Chaitanya had this ecstatic love; he ‘took a wood for the sacred grove of Vrindavan and the ocean for the dark waters of the Jamuna’. Second, one has no feeling of ‘my-ness’ toward the body, which is so dear to man. One wholly gets rid of the feeling that the body is the soul. “There are certain signs of God-realisation. The man in whom longing for God manifests its glories is not far from attaining Him. What are the glories of that longing? They are discrimination, dispassion, compassion for living beings, serving holy men, loving their company, chanting the name and glories of God, telling the truth, and the like. When you see those signs of longing in an aspirant, you can rightly say that for him the vision of God is not far to seek. “The state of a servant’s house will tell you unmistakably whether his master has decided to visit it.

Every time they are born they are devoted to God. An ordinary man acquires a little devotion after austerities and a hard struggle. But these boys have love of God from the very moment of their birth. They are like the natural image of Siva, which springs forth from the earth and is not set up by human hands. “The ever-perfect form a class by themselves. Not all birds have crooked beaks. The ever-perfect are never attached to the world. There is the instance of Prahlada. “Ordinary people practise spiritual discipline and cultivate devotion to God; but they also become attached to the world and are caught in the clamour of ‘woman and gold’. They are like flies, which sit on a flower or a sweetmeat and light on filth as well. “But the ever-perfect",

(Mam Eva BG 7.14 ) “The devotion of the ever-perfect is not like the ordinary devotion that one acquires as a result of strenuous spiritual discipline. Ritualistic devotion consists in repeating the name of God and performing worship in a prescribed manner. It is like crossing a rice-field in a roundabout way along the balk. Again, it is like reaching a near-by village by boat in a roundabout way along a winding river. “One does not follow the injunctions of ceremonial worship when one develops raga-bhakti, when one loves God as one’s own. Then it is like crossing a rice-field after the harvest. You don’t have to walk along the balk. You can go straight across the field in any direction. “When the country is flooded deep with water, one doesn’t have to follow the winding river. Then the fields are deep under water. You can row your boat straight to the village. “Without this intense attachment, this passionate love, one cannot realise God.” AMRITA: “Sir, how do you feel in samadhi?”",

However hard you may rub a grain of gold against a grindstone, still a bit of it always remains. Or again, take the case of a big fire; the ego is like one of its sparks. In samadhi I lose outer consciousness completely; but God generally keeps a little trace of ego in me for the enjoyment of divine communion. Enjoyment is possible only when ‘I’ and ‘you’ remain. “Again, sometimes God effaces even that trace of ‘I’. Then one experiences jada samadhi or nirvikalpa samadhi. That experience cannot be described. A salt doll went to measure the depth of the ocean, but before it had gone far into the water it melted away. It became entirely one with the water of the ocean.

So intense is one’s love of God that one becomes unconscious of outer things. Chaitanya had this ecstatic love; he ‘took a wood for the sacred grove of Vrindavan and the ocean for the dark waters of the Jamuna’. Second, one has no feeling of ‘my-ness’ toward the body, which is so dear to man. One wholly gets rid of the feeling that the body is the soul. “There are certain signs of God-realisation. The man in whom longing for God manifests its glories is not far from attaining Him. What are the glories of that longing? They are discrimination, dispassion, compassion for living beings, serving holy men, loving their company, chanting the name and glories of God, telling the truth, and the like. When you see those signs of longing in an aspirant, you can rightly say that for him the vision of God is not far to seek. “The state of a servant’s house will tell you unmistakably whether his master has decided to visit it.

When you see these things arriving, you conclude that the master will very soon come.” A DEVOTEE: “Sir, should one first practise discrimination to attain self-control?” MASTER: “That is also a path. It is called the path of vichara, reasoning. But the inner organs (Mind (manas), intelligence (buddhi), mind-stuff (chitta), and ego (ahamkara).) are brought under control naturally through the path of devotion as well. It is rather easily accomplished that way. Sense pleasures appear more and more tasteless as love for God grows.

Having abandoned bad qualities, the aspirant acquires good qualities, and then abandoning both, he attains the supreme Brahman. This is the state of perfection. All the other states are imperfect. Some of the religions are content with the teaching of ethical principles and a moral code of conduct. It is good in itself, but that is not enough. The aspirant should purify himself by ethical conduct, and then find his identity with the Supreme. That is the ultimate goal. There is no resting ground anywhere below that state.

Thousand( Sahasra ) implies almost infinite but technically speaking we cannot use the word ‘Infinite’ because the number of living beings in the creation is not infinite. There must be a certain number. But human language is not sufficient even to name the figure. For some ‘Mystical’ reason, the Rishis used the words ‘ Sata ‘(100) and ‘ Sahasra ‘(1000) not only for the respective figures but also to denote “uncountable” in number. Scriptures say that God has uncountable names and all names are his names. But still we use ‘ Satanama ‘ and ‘ sahasranamas ‘ while worshiping God. The words ‘ Sata and ‘ Sahasra ‘ are not meant for restricting it to 100 or 1000 but to convey the ‘Wholeness’. This verse explains the unity of all living beings. Even though, the external world appears with several living entities, the underlying principle(i.e., Lord Rudra ) in all the beings is only one. The Self or Atman or Purusha is same in all.

It is without and within all beings. It is unmoving and also moving. It is incomprehensible because It is subtle. It is far away, and yet It is near. It is indivisible, and yet It is, as it were, divided among beings. That Knowable Brahman is the Sustainer of all beings, and also their Devourer and Generator. The Light even of lights, It is said to be beyond darkness. As knowledge, the object of knowledge, and the goal of knowledge, It is set firm in the hearts of all. Whatever path is followed, Karma, Bhakti, Yoga or Dhyana, the end of the spiritual pilgrimage is Brahman. Brahma-Jnana liberates man from the horrible dream of ignorance, birth and death. Man knows the reality and that he is himself one with the Reality. So the seeker should contemplate the Knowable (Jneyam: Brahman) and realise his identity with That. The idea is that with the destruction of the vasanas, one should possess the Knowledge of the Supreme. May all the seekers discard all foolish and impure notions of their being flesh and blood and know themselves to be the blissful and ever-blessed Paramatma. So near He is to beings, witnessing all that they think and do, that they should never commit evil and sin in any manner what-so-ever. Only the vision of knowledge reveals the Supreme. This ignorance is itself darkness. jnanam, jneyam, jnanagamyam: The first word (jnana) stands for knowledge. The second word (Jneyam) means Atman. The third is ‘Jnanagamyam’ – Here the word ‘jnanam’ stands for qualities like humility etc., which lead to the understanding of Brahman. No other knowledge can achieve this liberation for mankind. Certainly, the answer is by the full possession of the qualities of Jnana-like amanitvam, ‘adambhitvam’ etc. Whether one looks out at the manifested universe or looks within at the Atma the same Brahman exists. But the Master said that the Knowledge of Brahman was not possible without the complete destruction of worldliness. “Whatever we see or think about is the manifestation of the glory of the Primordial Energy, the Primal Consciousness. Creation, preservation, and destruction, living beings and the universe, and further, meditation and the meditator, bhakti and prema — all these are manifestations of the glory of that Power.",

But the Master said that the Knowledge of Brahman was not possible without the complete destruction of worldliness. Further, he said that it was impossible for a man totally to withdraw his mind from the objects of the senses in the Kaliyuga, when his life was dependent on food. That is why the Master discouraged people from attempting the Vedic worship of Brahman and asked them to worship Sakti, the Divine Mother, who is identical with Brahman. MASTER (to Ishan): “Why do you waste your time simply repeating ‘Neti, neti’? Nothing whatsoever can be specified about Brahman, except that It exists. “Whatever we see or think about is the manifestation of the glory of the Primordial Energy, the Primal Consciousness.

From this relationship of master and servant spring up other attitudes: the attitude of serene love for God, the attitude of friend toward friend, and so forth. When the master loves his servant, he may say to him, ‘Come, sit by my side; there is no difference between you and me.’ But if the servant comes forward of his own will to sit by the master, will not the master be angry? “God’s play on earth as an Incarnation is the manifestation of the glory of the Chitsakti, the Divine Power.

But the Master said that the Knowledge of Brahman was not possible without the complete destruction of worldliness. Further, he said that it was impossible for a man totally to withdraw his mind from the objects of the senses in the Kaliyuga, when his life was dependent on food. That is why the Master discouraged people from attempting the Vedic worship of Brahman and asked them to worship Sakti, the Divine Mother, who is identical with Brahman.

Prakriti is the cause, (i.e.) all these things are produced by Prakriti. So Prakriti is the cause of these things. Prakriti is inert (Jada) and so cannot have the power of experiencing joy and sorrow. Purusha is pure consciousness. So He cannot be subject to joy and sorrow. But by the senses of Prakriti, the Purusha appears to be experiencing these modifications of joy and sorrow. Really Purusha does not cause anything nor does anything affect Him in any way. He is neither cause nor effect, neither the modifications nor the experiencer of them.

Attahment is bondage, detachment is freedom. In a huge factory, several small wheels rotate by the power of the fly-wheel. If the belt of the fly-wheel is snapped, the other smaller wheels stop rotating automatically. If the mainspring of a watch is cut off, all the other wheels stop moving. Thus if the contact with the body and the Gunas of Prakriti is given up completely, the whole series of births and deaths come to end, and that very moment man attains freedom and perfection. Commentary by Swami Shuddhidananda Purusha, embodied in Prakriti….. Ashu Mitra wrote about an interesting event: “Once we printed some photos of Holy Mother (size 12″ x 15″) from the studio of a European photographer. I gave one copy to the Mother to see; she took it with both hands and then touched it with her forehead. Seeing her childlike action, I suppressed my laughter. When she returned the photo, I asked her, ‘Mother, whose photo is this?’ Like a simple girl, she replied: ‘Why? It is my picture.’",

The moving and non-moving objects, whatever they are, all of them and every one of them, are produced by the union of Prakriti and Purusha (kshetra and kshetrajna). Knowing this man has to cultivate universal love as the rule of conduct in life. Does God exist in the stone? The answer is that the stone cannot have any existence at all, without the union with the Lord. The stone as stone would not be there. This being so, is it any wonder that the Lord is present in living beings, animals, birds or men? So in the trees and mountains, rivers and valleys, fields and meadows, in the ant, in the sparrow, in the deer and the tiger, in men, in demons and the Gods, Paramatma exists. Such faith is needed for God-realisation.

Just as the individual soul is encased in the living body, so is the universal Soul in the Living Prakriti [Nature] — the objective universe. Shivâ [i.e. Kâli] is embracing Shiva: this is not a fancy. This covering of the one [Soul] by the other [Nature] is analogous to the relation between an idea and the word expressing it: they are one and the same; and it is only by a mental abstraction that one can distinguish them. Thought is impossible without words. Therefore, in the beginning was the Word etc. This dual aspect of the Universal Soul is eternal. So what we perceive or feel is this combination of the Eternally Formed and the Eternally Formless.

But his candour in pointing out a person’s defects often proved painful. One day he came across this verse of the Bhagavata: “Realizing the universe as one in the aspect of Purusha and prakriti, never praise or blame the action of others” (11. 28. 1). Then he read the commentary on that verse: “If accidentally the teeth bite the tongue, hurt and cut it, do people take a piece of stone and break the teeth? No, because the teeth belong to the same person to whom the tongue belongs. Since the one Lord who is in me also resides in others, it is improper to find fault",

Shame on those who, disregarding the visible Brahman, set their minds on other things! Here is the Brahman before you as tangible as a fruit in your hand! Can’t you see!

Each one for himself, and somebody take the hindermost — that is all the morality in the world, at least with many. You cannot explain it except when you come to know the truth as given in the Gita: “He who sees everyone in himself, and himself in everyone, thus seeing the same God living in all, he, the sage, no more kills the Self by the self.” Know through Advaita that whomsoever you hurt, you hurt yourself; they are all you. All hatred is killing the “Self by the self”, therefore love is the law of life.

Then and then alone one finds out the truth of that grand old teaching. What is the teaching? “Even in this life they have conquered the round of birth and death whose minds are firm-fixed on the sameness of everything, for God is pure and the same to all, and therefore such are said to be living in God.” “Thus seeing the Lord the same everywhere, he, the sage, does not hurt the Self by the self, and so goes to the highest goal.” [Source] Advaita and Advaita alone explains morality. Every religion preaches that the essence of all morality is to do good to others. And why? Be unselfish. And why should I? Some God has said it? He is not for me. Some texts have declared it? Let them; that is nothing to me; let them all tell it. And if they do, what is it to me? Each one for himself, and somebody take the hindermost — that is all the morality",

You cannot explain it except when you come to know the truth as given in the Gita: “He who sees everyone in himself, and himself in everyone, thus seeing the same God living in all, he, the sage, no more kills the Self by the self.” Know through Advaita that whomsoever you hurt, you hurt yourself; they are all you. Whether you know it or not, through all hands you work, through all feet you move, you are the king enjoying in the palace, you are the beggar leading that miserable existence in the street; you are in the ignorant as well as in the learned, you are in the man who is weak, and you are in the strong; know this and be sympathetic. And that is why we must not hurt others. That is why I do not even care whether I have to starve, because there will be millions of mouths eating at the same time, and they are all mine. Therefore I should not care what becomes of me and mine, for the whole universe is mine, I am enjoying",

They say I have bad work or this good work; I am – happy or I am sorrowful; I am dull or I am intelligent and so on.’ This is ‘Ahamkara’ – a false identification of the Self with body and mind ( 3.27 ).

Paramatma is One. The sun – gives light. Paramatma is light. The Sun has nothing to do with good and bad nature of men and their actions in the world. Paramatma similarly is not concerned with the functions of the body, mind and intellect. He is just the witness, like the Sun. If the sun is not there, the whole world becomes lifeless and dark. So also if Paramatma is not there, the universe would crumble to pieces and disappear into darkness and death.",

The union with the Lord liberates the sage from birth and death. He becomes ‘ajah’, ‘nityah’. There is no ‘return’ for him.

But in the perfect Atmic state, even this Sattva guna pure and light-giving as it is, is an obstacle, a covering veil to Atma. If a pure light is covered by glasses of three colours, different effects are produced. If the glass is dark, the light is dim. If the glass is red, the light casts a red shadow. If the glass is white the light is clear. But the white glass also is a covering veil to the pure light within. The original purity of the light itself is modified by the glass, however clean it might be. So also the sattva guna binds the jiva by attachment to happiness and knowledge.

The effect of this passion is activity to gain this or that object, wealth, name and fame, power and position etc. The mad rush that one sees in the world is all the manifestation of Rajoguna. Territories are gained, wars are fought, enemies are put down, name is achieved, fame is obtained and thus in a hundred ways, man works for selfish ends and aims; This is Rajoguna. Thus action is the outer manifestation of Rajoguna. The Rajasic man cannot remain quiet. He is urged into action by the very force of Rajas. Action binds him. In this also, there is the false imposition of Kshetradharma on the pure and perfect Atma. The Lord uses a very strong word ‘nibadhnati’, not simply ‘badhnati’ when he speaks of the binding power of Rajoguna and tamoguna. Commentary by Swami Chetanananda",

The state of the Jiva under its influence is like the sun being covered up by thick dark clouds, or like a light covered up by dark smoke-stained glass. Its deluding power is universally felt, by all, except the Jivanmuktas. That is why the word Sarvadehinam is used. Even the most intelligent are sometimes blind to the realities of a situation. They err, fall into lethargy, and forget themselves in beastly sleep. The common run of mankind is directly under its power. Sleep, idleness, incapacity, inefficiency, neglect of duty, shirking of work, all these are Tamoguna qualities. Each individual can easily find out for himself what his nature is. If he is negligent, idle and sleepy, it is a sure sign that Tamas predominates in his nature. It is to be understood that no man is dominated only by one Guna. The three Gunas attending express themselves in the mind, at one stage or other. When Tamas dominates, he sleeps, when Rajas dominates he acts, and when Sattva comes up, he is calm and enjoys the bliss of power. The",

But in the third instance, the pot being opaque, the light within is totally covered. The state of Tamas is utter darkness. The man in darkness stumbles and falls, mistakes objects, takes one thing to be another, and thus commits a number of mistakes.

When Sattvaguna functions, the other two gunas are over-powered. So also when Rajoguna functions, the other two are suppressed; when Tamoguna is powerful the other two gunas are overpowered. Therefore the seekers have to strengthen Sattvaguna and by its power suppress the other two Gunas. That is the first thing to be done in spiritual practice. Rajas and Tamas should be eliminated and it can be done only by nourishing Sattvaguna at all times. If Sattva dominates the seeker has ascended to a very high plane, and from there, it would not be far away to rise above it in the realisation of God. Swami Vivekananda Says — With the prevalence of the sattvika essence, man becomes inactive and rests always in a state of deep dhyana or contemplation; with the prevalence of the rajas, he does bad as well as good works; and with the prevalence of the tamas again, he becomes inactive and inert.

This truth is declared in this verse. We can easily identify the man of Sattva-guna and in the same way we can identify the people of Rajo-guna and Tamo-guna by their activities. Sattva is light and knowledge. The intellect (Buddhi) is then sharp and clear. He sees things as they are, and is not perturbed or troubled by the happenings around him. Such balanced conduct is the quality of Sattva. In fact, the external life of a man is itself the measuring metre to find out what his nature is.

Greed and longing urge him to undertake many actions for the fulfillment of his desires. These desires are sometimes selfish and prohibited by the Sastras. Longing for objects drives him into acts of evil and sin. He employs tricks and stratagems to realise his ambitions. He has no regard for truth. His mind is externalised. He has no introspection. He is like the ocean troubled by a tempest. His words are harsh and proud. He walks unsteadily because of his mental restlessness. His mind is full of desire for this and that.

Inertness, disinclination towards activity of any kind, delusion and erroneous thoughts and opinions about things, all these arise from Tamo-guna. The man whose nature is dominated – by this guna can be discovered by what be eats, what he speaks, and by his general behaviour. The sourness of an unripe mango is a suitable comparison for Tamo-guna. Kumbhakarna is an example of Tamo-guna. It is quite possible for each individual to understand his own nature, whether it is Sattvic or Rajasic or Tamasic. It has already been pointed out that these qualities function in an endless cycle. The same man is Sattivic some times, Rajasic some times and Tamasic some times. When the Sattvic spell comes, to recognise it and confirm it in one’s nature is the way to eliminate the other two qualities gradually. Nothing can be done in a day. Perseverance will ultimately conquer all obstacles. So, the seekers have to be vigilant, and when the darker quality tries to dominate him, he should overcome it with all the strength and force of his will-power. The tree should be watered at the roots; If",

Tamas and Rajas have to be eliminated by Nishkama Karma, by devotion and by studious understanding of the Truth. If a man cultivates Sattva-guna through a long life-time of steady practice, then, even at the time of death, his mind remains pure, calm, and full of peace.

So the seekers have to be vigilant and cautious and observe how they are progressing on the path of self-purification. They should remember that their future life in other worlds will be strictly determined by their state of mind in this life. They should refrain from any evil and sinful acts because they are caused by impure Rajas and Tamas. Otherwise, they shall have to suffer in low worlds of a painful nature.",

He suffers from pain, restlessness, horrid dreams, fears, deluding hopes, disappointments, despair, desperation and despondency. Such is Rajo-guna. And now when we come to Tamoguna, it is all darkness and ignorance. Under its power man lives like an animal. He eats, sleeps, and copulates. He has no idea of anything pure and holy. He lives an animal life. Nay, he is worse than animals. Being born as man and yet live the life of animals",

The seekers who are enquiring into Truth should understand the idea and keep it always in their mind. It is the direct path to Brahma jnana (Moksha), liberation from the bondage of samsara. Therefore, the seeker has to understand that he is entirely distinct and separate from the three Gunas, that he is Atma, and hence that he is not at all the agent (karta) or enjoyer (bhokta). So the first step towards liberation is to know that the real man is the seer (neither Karta nor Bhokta). You are in truth, Atma. Out of delusion, the Jiva identifies himself with the gunas, and attributes to himself what is Deha dharma and Mano-dharma. He says, ‘I am born; I am sick or healthy; I die; I am old or young;’ Thus he is clearly identifying himself with the body. He says again, “I am happy; I am sad; 1 am angry; I am calm; I am dull or I am bright.” Thus he is identifying himself with the mind and its changes.

    "text": "This verse and the next are very important. The seekers who are enquiring into Truth should understand the idea and keep it always in their mind. It is the direct path to Brahma jnana (Moksha), liberation from the bondage of samsara. Whatever actions are performed by man, the agent invariably, is the Gunas (i.e), the mind which is composed of the three Gunas. Except the three Gunas there is no other thing as the mind. The mind through the agency of the senses and the body, causes all actions. The senses and the body, are instruments. The mind is the directing agent. What is bound is the mind; and what attains liberation is the mind. There is no other agent or enjoyer. Atma is distinct from this mind. Therefore, the seeker has to understand that he is entirely distinct and separate from the three Gunas, that he is Atma, and hence that he is not at all the agent (karta) or enjoyer (bhokta). When this distinction is clearly seen, man remains as the seer (Drik). He realises Atma. So the first step towards liberation is to know that the real man is the seer (neither Karta nor Bhokta). O Jiva!",

You are in truth, Atma. This is Lord’s compassionate teaching. In the spectacular drama of the universe, the real actor is the mind, the three gunas. And the Atma, like the lighting in the theatre, is shedding its light on all, while remaining unattached to anything that is taking place on the stage. He is like the screen of the theatre on which the picture is projected. The picture is constantly changing and displaying various colours, characters and actions. The screen is not affected by the picture, whether it is a tragedy or a farce or anything else. Even so, the Atma stands really unattached and unaffected by the wailings and laughters of the mind, by the functions of the senses, and by the activities of the body. This is the highest Truth. All that is considered happiness or sorrow is only the modifications of the three gunas. Out of delusion, the Jiva identifies himself with the gunas, and attributes to",

This idea of false identification is what is called ‘avidya’. The moment when the falsehood is found out, that very moment the Jiva knows that he is Atma, and there is no more a ‘Karta’ or a ‘Bhokta’ to be bound to the world. All bondage is shattered at one stroke. Madbhavam so adhigacchati: Knowing that the gunas are the cause of all actions and knowing that he is the ‘drashta’ the Jiva becomes Siva, the nara (man) becomes Narayana, the Jana (man) becomes Janardana.

    "text": "The tree of samsara is vividly described here. It is not a small tree. It has grown strong and firm from millions of births, and has deeply established its roots in the world. Its branches spread upto Brahma loka. Its roots are the past samskaras of action. The three Gunas are its branches. Its tender shoots grow by enjoyment of sense-objects. How then to cut this mighty tree? The branches should be struck by purifying the mind of the three Gunas; the tender shoots should be cut by dispassion towards sense-enjoyments; and the roots should be destroyed by removing the past tendencies of the mind. As all trees are sustained by their roots, this tree of samsara is sustained by deeply impregnated ‘samskaras’ or ‘vasanas’, and when they are destroyed, the whole tree falls to the ground being struck at the roots. It is there that the operation should be conducted. When the roots are cut, the branches, shoots and buds wither away in a short time. The wise man therefore should cultivate dispassion (vairagya) towards sense-objects. Dispassion brings about the cessation of the impulses and urgings of action. Where there is no action, there is no bondage, resulting from",

From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned and winked. One fig was a husband and a happy home and children, and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor, and another fig was Ee Gee, the amazing editor, and another fig was Europe and Africa and South America, and another fig was Constantin and Socrates and Attila and a pack of other lovers with queer names and offbeat professions, and another fig was an Olympic lady crew champion, and beyond and above these figs were many more figs I couldn’t quite make out.

Though apparently divided by names and forms through the inscrutable power of maya, that enchantress who makes the impossible possible, Brahman is really One and undivided. When a seeker merges in the beatitude of samadhi, he does not perceive time and space or name and form, the offspring of maya. Whatever is within the domain of maya is unreal. Give it up. Destroy the prison-house of name and form and rush out of it with the strength of a lion. Dive deep in search of the Self and realise It through samadhi. You will find the world of name and form vanishing into void, and the puny ego dissolving in Brahman-Consciousness.

He found it impossible to take his mind beyond Kali, the Divine Mother of the Universe. “After the initiation”, Sri Ramakrishna once said, describing the event, “Nangta began to teach me the various conclusions of the Advaita Vedanta and asked me to withdraw the mind completely from all objects and dive deep into the Atman.

It is all illusion. “He from whom blight and delusion have fallen, he who has conquered the evils of association, he alone is āzād (free)..” [Source] Swami Turiyananda: Constant discrimination sharpens the intellect. Truth reveals itself to a man who is always discriminating to attain it. One must always keep the sword of discrimination ready at hand. The Lord says in the Gitâ that we must cut down the deep-rooted Ashwattha (of Samsâra or the relative world) with the sword of non-attachment, and seek to enter that blessed state from which there is no return.

In other words, it is dispassion (vairagya). What a wonderful weapon to smash the tree of samsara! But the axe should be sharp and strong. Lukewarm and fitful vairagya (manda vairagya) is not enough. It should be blazing, burning, all-consuming ‘vairagya’. How else can this mighty tree be cut? That is why the Lord uses the word ‘dridhena’ as attribute to ‘asanga sastra’, This axe of dispassion cuts the very root of the tree and there is no more delusion or bondage. It is like destroying the main wheel of a huge factory-machine. When the main wheel is stopped, all the innumerable smaller wheels stop automatically. We need not stop every small wheel. So also, when the roots of the tree are cut, the branches, the buds and all other things wither away of their own accord. This non-attachment should be both",

Having given up the ‘ drisya ‘, the objective world, the next step is to hold fast to the ‘ Drik ‘ the seer. This is important. It is not enough to clear the debts; one should acquire property, and then only he will be safe. The rejection of the sense-world is like clearing the debts. So along with ‘vairagya’ the seeker should possess jnana, knowledge of Paramatma. He should know that his real nature is Atma. Then his bliss is full and unhindered. That is why the Lord teaches That is then, the Atma is to be searched for (parimargitavyayam). This is the highest state for a human being, because, having once attained it, man does not return to samsara again ( na nivartanti bhuyah ). It is the law that man has to return to this world again and again whatever world he goes to by his good work until he realises Paramatma. That wise attain it and are forever at rest. The path to take for this search for the highest Truth is clearly stated here.",

At the last stage one should have Vairagya and cut up this personal God who defies the mind to rise to higher unity as in the case of Sri Ramakrishna. This is the final obstacle in the path of spiritual life and it is here that even the highest Bhaktas like the dualistic devotees stop as they refuse to consider anything superior to this devotion. The only difference between the two Mukhya Bhakti and Para Bhakti may be noted as the realisation of unity as the highest Truth.

Totapuri began to impart to Sri Ramakrishna the great truths of Vedanta. “Brahman”, he said, “is the only Reality, ever pure, ever illumined, ever free, beyond the limits of time, space, and causation. Though apparently divided by names and forms through the inscrutable power of maya, that enchantress who makes the impossible possible, Brahman is really One and undivided. When a seeker merges in the beatitude of samadhi, he does not perceive time and space or name and form, the offspring of maya. Whatever is within the domain of maya is unreal. Give it up. Destroy the prison-house of name and form and rush out of it with the strength of a lion. Dive deep in search of the Self and realise It through samadhi. You will find the world of name and form vanishing into void, and the puny ego dissolving in Brahman-Consciousness. You will realise your identity with Brahman, Existence-Knowledge-Bliss Absolute.” Quoting the Upanishad, Totapuri said: “That knowledge is shallow by which one sees or hears or knows another. What is shallow is worthless and can never give",

But the Knowledge by which one does not see another or hear another or know another, which is beyond duality, is great, and through such Knowledge one attains the Infinite Bliss. How can the mind and senses grasp That which shines in the heart of all as the Eternal Subject?” Totapuri asked the disciple to withdraw his mind from all objects of the relative world, including the gods and goddesses, and to concentrate on the Absolute. But the task was not easy even for Sri Ramakrishna. He found it impossible to take his mind beyond Kali, the Divine Mother of the Universe. “After the initiation”, Sri Ramakrishna once said, describing the event, “Nangta began to teach me the various conclusions of the Advaita Vedanta and asked me to withdraw the mind completely from all objects and dive deep into the Atman. But in spite of all my attempts I could not altogether cross the realm of name and form and bring my mind to the unconditioned state. I had no difficulty in taking the mind from all the objects of the world. But the radiant and too familiar figure of the Blissful Mother, the Embodiment of the essence",

Finding a piece of glass he took it up and stuck it between my eyebrows. ‘Concentrate the mind on this point!’ he thundered. Then with stern determination I again sat to meditate.

Swami Vivekananda Says — Cut down the banyan tree of desire with the axe of non-attachment, and it will vanish utterly. It is all illusion. “He from whom blight and delusion have fallen, he who has conquered the evils of association, he alone is āzād (free)..” [Source] Swami Turiyananda: Constant discrimination sharpens the intellect. Truth reveals itself to a man who is always discriminating to attain it. One must always keep the sword of discrimination ready at hand. The Lord says in the Gitâ that we must cut down the deep-rooted Ashwattha (of Samsâra or the relative world) with the sword of non-attachment, and seek to enter that blessed state from which there is no return.

Therefore this body-identification (dehatma-buddhi) should be given up once and for all. ‘I am Atma’ is the Mahamantra. Moreover, the word Isvara (Lord) is used with reference to Jivatma. The Jiva in truth is the Lord of the senses, the mind, and the body and all that pertains to it. He is the master and not the slave and bondman as he is now thinking and behaving. What a fall is there – from the state of the supreme ruler to the humiliating state of a servant! This is what has happened to man. He, the ruler, has no freedom or will of his own. He has to behave according to the dictates of the mind and the senses. He has reduced himself to this wretched position, by gross ignorance. “So, give up the slavery. Awake, arise and affirm your real nature? Thou art Paramatma!” This is the trumpet call of Lord Krishna to all mankind.

These determine the nature of the next birth. If these are pure, naturally the jiva is born to pure parents and enjoy a pure life. If these are impure, he is born to impure and sinful wombs, be the wombs of beasts, birds or reptiles. So one’s may future life is in his own hands. He should therefore take to spiritual sadhana even now immediately and escape from the miserable fate of being born as beasts and reptiles hereafter.

Commentary by Swami Shuddhidananda Bhagavad Gita 15.8 to 15.11 by Swami Chetanananda Kundalini, the repository of accumulated past impressions; how these impressions are wiped out. The yogis and sages of the East, especially of India, say that good and bad thoughts do not merely leave their marks on the brain: They become transformed into an impelling subtle force that engages you in good or bad actions in the future. This force remains eternally at the base of the tailbone, the basic centre of kundalini, which is called muladhara. This is the dwelling place of the motivating powers that accumulate birth after birth, which are called samskaras, or past impressions.",

These also do japa, dhyana and other practices, but they fail because the heart is impure, (i.e. vitiated by powerful vasanas binding them to the external world).

They do not possess real self-control, and so they fail in their search for Paramatma. We hear that the Lord insists on purity of heart as the essential condition for Atmajnana.

The Lord answers that it is His Light that is shining in the Sun, the Moon, and the Fire. Paramatma alone is the One Light, and that is reflected through different media like the Sun, the Moon and the Fire. This should be clearly understood by the aspirants. Paramatma is Self-luminous; He is Light itself. Commentary by Swami Chetanananda Commentary by Swami Shuddhidananda Related Articles: Neither the sun, nor the moon, nor the fire can illumine",

From this declaration of the Lord, we come to know that Sri Krishna, the Charioteer of Arjuna, is not simply the child of Devaki (a little ‘upadhi’ like innumerable other beings), but the all-pervading, all-supporting Paramatma. Moreover, the food one eats is nourished by the Lord’s energy, permeating the world. Without Him, there would be no food for man. So when man feeds himself he should remember the Lord from whom the food has come to him. He is the mightiest producer and also distributor. He is the giver of the food. Should we not be grateful to Lord? Should we not offer to the Lord what belongs to Him?

Not only does the Lord produce food, He is also the digestive energy in all living beings. The body is built by food, and the food eaten should be properly digested before it turns into blood and vital energy. The digestive Fire ( Jatharagni ) is the Lord Himself in the form of vaisvanara . So the Lord is the Creator as well as the nourisher of the body. In this way, man is wholly the product of the Lord and all the energy which he possesses comes to him from the Lord. He who eats the food without offering to the Lord is a thief, misappropriating to himself what is not really his ( yo bhunkte stena eva saha 3.12). That is why there is the sadachara in the world of offering food to God as naivedyam before eating. What is eaten without such an offering is impure food.

It is certainly better to live on roots and leaves obtained by righteous means than on luxurious dishes got by cheating, stealth and other unrighteous (adharmic) ways. The Lord is observing from within every morsel that one eats. The law of moderation has already been enunciated by the Lord ( Yuktaharaviharasya 6.17). As the Chapter deals with food it has become sadachara to recite it collectively or separately at the time of eating. In Asramas, Matts and houses, this practice is followed by most people. Food eaten in this spirit is a real offering to the Lord. He accepts it. Besides, such food permeates every particle of the body with divine purity and energy.

I thought he knew I was hungry and was going to give them to me, but he did just the opposite. He took them himself. He then asked me to give him a glass of water, which he drank. Then, with evident signs of satiety, he said: “Oh, how relieved I am! I am satisfied.” And strange to say, his satisfaction removed my hunger and thirst.

    "text": "Kshara Purusha, Akshara Purusha, and Purushothama – This Discourse deals with these three Purushas. First, the Kshara Purusha is explained. He who identifies himself with the physical body is Kshara Purusha. He who identifies himself with the mind is called Akshara Purusha. Compared with the body which perishes every time it is born, the mind, which endures birth after birth till the moment of liberation (Moksha), is said to be Akshara or Kutasthah (the immovable). This Akshara Purusha (Manobhimani) Jiva is not the same as the Akshara Parabrahman described in the 8th Discourse . These are poles apart. Brahman is the original Sun and the Jiva is the reflection of the Sun in water. The Jiva mentioned here is different from Brahman of the 8th discourse. In the coming verse , the Lord describes Purusha who is different from Kshara Purusha and the Akshara Purusha (Jiva) who is the reflected consciousness of Paramatma in the body. Commentary by Swami Chetanananda Commentary by Swami Shuddhidananda Sri Ramakrishna Krishna Says — “I was twenty-two or twenty-three when the Divine Mother one day asked me in the Kali temple, ‘Do you want to be Akshara ?’ I didn’t know what the word meant.",

Some people live in the state of the body (have dehasthiti), and some in the state of the Jiva (have Jivasthiti). He who lives in Atma alone is the Supreme Purusha. This is the goal to be attained by all with determined effort. The thoughtful man should not waste his life in the bound conditions of the Jiva. He should find his freedom and perfection. He should go beyond the body-state, the Jiva-state and realise the Atmic state (i.e) the state of the Supreme Purusha. That is the end and aim of life. Nothing else can",

In course of conversation he said: “Formerly, the Master and Hriday used to live in the large room of the Kuthi (a building in the Dakshineswar temple) and the Master’s mother used to sleep in an adjoining small room. Many nights they used to hear a man with shoes on going up and down the stairs, and opening doors and windows. It was a ghost-possibly of a European. For the Kuthi had been a European residence before the temple was built. The Master used to say, ‘We cannot say that this world is entirely false. For we are actually seeing it with our eyes.

Really speaking, the demonical state is not sampat (treasure) at all. And yet people are so deluded that they hug these wicked qualities and think of themselves as great men. The Lord mentions six qualities of the demonical nature. They are elaborately discussed in this discourse. In the great war with Maya, it is necessary to know and understand the power of the enemy forces as well as the forces of one’s own. Only then it would be possible to wage successful war with the enemy. If anybody wants to live in a house, he should first of all clean it of the dust, cobwebs and other foul things, and then light some scented sticks to purify the atmosphere. So also, man should keep the body pure, the foul things in it should be ejected and nourishing food should be taken in. In the same manner, purity of mind should be cultivated by abandoning the bad qualities which",

When a man knows the effects of the things, he is induced to accept things, which yield good results and abandon others which yield bad results. Divine nature leads to liberation, the demonical leads to bondage. The two natures function in opposite directions and yield opposite results. One liberates and the other binds, enslaves. The thoughtful know what to choose, between freedom and slavery. No one wants pain and suffering, ignorance and darkness, slavery and bondage. Therefore it is our duty to dispel darkness with light, to remove ignorance with knowledge, and to crush demonical nature with divine. These two hostile natures, the divine and the demonical are not racial or national or family qualities. After a man is born, these two natures develop gradually in him. By right type of control, guidance and training, the mind falls into the groove of divine qualities, and then it attains the highest rewards of self-realisation. On the other hand, if the mind falls into the wrong groove, it acquires all evil qualities and the man falls into lower planes of life. Arjuna is assured by the Lord",

He knows that the Divine nature is the way to the highest goal and the demonical leads to destruction. Even this is not known to people of the Asuric type.",

Who would not surrender to the Lord? Who would not pray to Him to be saved? We can understand why the Lord presents the fate of evil-doers so picturesquely, so intensely and with such terrific force. He warns mankind, a terrible warning it is indeed which only the most abandoned souls could fail to understand. Let mankind wake up to truth, and know where they are, what they are, and what their fate would be. Let them not",

They are the three evils ( Dushtatrayam ) which directly lead man into the lower worlds. When these gates are shut by dispassion, love and detachment, there is no fear for man. The demonical qualities so elaborately described so far, are epitomised and classified into three essential evils 1. Desire, 2. Wrath, 3. Greed. Desire is to be conquered by dispassion, wrath by love, greed by discrimination and detachment. There is hope for the awakened souls who have become conscious of the evils in them, and the horrible future that awaits them if they do not destroy these evils. Striving for purity and the higher way of life they shall shut down the gateway to Hell.

    "text": "The mind (the inner organ) is alone the Jiva (man). So if the mind is pure, purity becomes the essence of that man. Here the word ‘ sattva ‘ means mind. Every individual acquires that nature which he has brought with him from his experience in former births. And his faith takes on that quality only. He is that faith, qualified by his Samskaras. So it is the duty of man to instill Sattvic disposition into his character and by practice transcend that also to reach the highest state. The Tamasic and Rajasic kinds of Sraddha should be abandoned, because they also pull man downwards into lower forms of existence. Among the qualities, Sattva is the nearest to Atma, and in Suddha-sattva, man directly perceives Atma, and enters the Nirguna state. That is the real Self of man, that is his final goal. Commentary by Swami Chetanananda Swami Vivekananda Says — What I think is practical, is to me the only practicality in the world. If I am a shopkeeper, I think shopkeeping the only practical pursuit in the world. If I am a thief, I think stealing is the best means of being practical; others are not practical. You",

Therefore I will ask you to understand that Vedanta, though it is intensely practical, is always so in the sense of the ideal. [Source] The Bhagavad Gita states: “A man consists of the faith that is in him. Whatever his faith is, he is.” A man of faith is free from fear, worry, and anxiety. Once there was a terrible fire in a neighbour’s house which was only fifteen yards from his own. A strong wind was blowing and occasionally sparks fell on Nag Mahashay’s roof. While the villagers were fighting to stop the blazing fire, Nag Mahashay stood before it with folded hands, unperturbed. Sharatkamini, however, was frightened and started throwing clothes, bedding, and blankets outside. Seeing her, Nag Mahashay cried out: “Shame on you! Still you have no faith in God! Brahma, the god of fire, has come. Instead of worshipping him, you are busy protecting these trifling objects! Victory to Sri Ramakrishna!” He started to dance in the courtyard. Then he added, “If God protects, no one can destroy; and if God destroys, no one can save.” The neighbour’s house was burned",

Once Sambhu said to me, ‘Please bless me, that I may die leaving my riches at the Lotus Feet of God.’ I answered: ‘These are riches only to you. What riches can you offer God? To Him these are mere dust and straw.’ “Once a thief broke into the temple of Vishnu and robbed the image of its jewels. Mathur Babu and I went to the temple to see what was the matter. Addressing the image, Mathur said bitterly: ‘What a shame, Lord! You are so worthless! The thief took all the ornaments from Your body, and You couldn’t do a thing about it.’ Thereupon I said to’Mathur: ‘Shame on you! How improper your words are!

Certainly not wealth! He wants from His devotees love, devotion, feeling, discrimination, and renunciation. “ One looks on God exactly according to one’s own inner feeling. Take, for instance, a devotee with an excess of tamas. He thinks that the Divine Mother eats goat. So he slaughters one for Her. Again, the devotee endowed with rajas cooks rice and various other dishes for the Mother. But the sattvic devotee doesn’t make any outer show of his worship. People don’t even know he is worshipping. If he has no flowers, he worships God with mere Ganges water and the leaves of the bel-tree. His food offering to the Deity consists of sweetened puffed rice or a few candies. Occasionally he cooks a little rice pudding for the Deity. “There is also another class of devotees, those who are beyond the three gunas. They have the nature of a child. Their worship consists in chanting God’s name — just His name. (Source: Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna ) —– “People of",

He went to the actor who played Kaikeyi, crying out, ‘You wretch!’, and was about to burn the actor’s face with a torch. He was a very pious man. After finishing his ablutions he would stand in the water and meditate on the Deity, reciting the invocation: ‘I meditate on Thee, of red hue and four faces’, while tears streamed down his cheeks. “When my father walked along the lanes of the village wearing his wooden sandals, the shopkeepers would stand up out of respect and say, ‘There he comes!’ When he bathed in the Haldarpukur, the villagers would not have the courage to get into the water.

Therefore a sannyasi should not salute his guru’s young wife, touching her feet. These are the rules for sannyasis. “But the case is quite different with householders. After the birth of one or two children, the husband and wife should live as brother and sister. The other seven kinds of sexual intercourse do not injure them much. “A householder has various debts: debts to the gods, to the fathers, and to the rishis. He also owes a debt to his wife.

One becomes virtuous by virtuous deeds and vicious by vicious acts (BrU 4.04.05). We all have the power to change. One becomes what one constantly and intensely thinks of, irrespective of reasons, such as reverence, fear, jealousy, love, or even hatred (BP 11.09.22). You always get what you look for — consciously or unconsciously. The thought produces action; action soon becomes habits and habit leads to success in any endeavor when it becomes passion.

It is not a negligible matter as some indulgent people imagine. It should be within the experience of everyone that when impure and offensive food is taken the mind immediately reacts by generating sensual tendencies, irritability, anger etc. If men take a little more care about their food and its regulation, not only will they be more healthy and happy, but they will also gain insight into the subtler truths of the spiritual realm. Such being the importance of food, the Lord first prescribes the type of food which is dear to the Sattvic type of men. Sri Ramakrishna Says — MASTER ( to M .): “Rakhal has indigestion. It is best to take only sattvic food. Haven’t you read about it in the Gita ? Don’t you read the Gita ?” ( BG 17.8 , BG 17.9 , BG 17.10 ) M: “Yes, sir. The Gita speaks of temperance in eating. Sattvic food, rajasic food, tamasic food; sattvic kindness, sattvic ego, and so on — all these are described in the Gita .” MASTER: “Have you",

The word ‘ati’ is applied to all the adjectives used, by some commentators. Sour, bitter, and burning food-stuffs should be abandoned, if spiritual progress is to be kept up by the Sadhaka. In the eighteenth Discourse 38th verse , the Lord explains that Rajasic happiness appears to be pleasing in the beginning but turns out to be extremely painful in the end. Similarly hot and sour food may be relishing to some palates, but they produce grievous discomfort, pain and disease, in the end. This is experienced by many in everyday life. Besides, Rajasic food disturbs Dhyana Sadhana. The mind becomes distracted and agitated and so it cannot remain steady in contemplation. Among the animals, lions, tigers, and wolves are restless and foul, whereas cows, goats and others of their kind are calm and non-injurious. amayapradah: Rajasic food produces disease. What can man achieve with a disease-sticken body? He has neither worldly nor spiritual welfare. So the seekers should abandon all such varieties of food and strive in every way to keep the body",

As a general practice, we have to shun exciting food. … We do not know how to vary our diet with our occupation. We always forget that it is the food out of which we manufacture everything we have. So the amount and kind of energy that we want, the food must determine. … The proper diet means, generally, simply do not eat highly spiced foods. There are three sorts of mind, says the yogi, according to the elements of nature. One is the dull mind, which covers the luminosity of the soul.

Spiritual development is not possible without the grace of God, Guru and Mahatmas. Maya does not easily give way for man to cross over. The obstacles cannot be cleared without their grace. So the real seeker should win their blessing by humility and reverence, by service and devotion, by worship and selfless service. Their grace is infinitely helpful for man. He becomes humble, wise, unselfish and the super-obstacle the Ego lets go its strangle-hold on the heart of man. That is why the Lord mentioned such worship as the first type of austerity for the body.",

Tamasika charity is performed on an impulse. It is always making mistakes. The doer thinks of nothing but his own impulse to be kind. Rajasika charity is what a man does for his own glory.

The very essence of all the Vedas is, as it were, distilled into that one symbol ‘Om’. So, the utterance of this sacred syllable is equal to the study of all the Vedas. Another interpretation for Om Tat Sat – Om: Para Brahman; Tat: That (Brahman alone); Sat: is (reality) Everything else in the entire objective universe is only a shadow unreal (Mithya). Therefore the Mantra Om Tat Sat implies the very highest truth of all the Vedas and the Sastras – Brahma satyam jagan mithya (Brahman is real, the universe is unreal). Thus the aspirants should utter this unique Mantra, contemplate the reality of Brahman, reject the unreal world, and develop dispassion and knowledge. They should firmly establish themselves in Brahman, the only reality. Two meanings could be given to Om Tat Sat as follows: 1. Om: Brahman (is); Tat: that (Brahman); Sat: Reality; 2. Tat: that; Sat: Reality; Om: (is) Brahman. Bhagavad Gita 17.23 to 17.28 by Swami Chetanananda",

Whatever may be the act performed by either Yajna or Dana or Tapas, or other good works, If there is no faith in the heart of the doer, it becomes utterly useless. It does not acquire the status of ‘Sat’. It is just ‘Asat’ (i.e.) something equal to zero, something not performed at all. Such acts bring no good either here or hereafter.

Thus, holding on to faith as the support, propelling force, and guiding light, man has to march forward towards the ultimate reality, the supreme Brahman. One day the Holy Mother invited Amzad for lunch and served him on the porch of her house. Owing to caste prejudices, Nalini, the Mother’s niece, threw the food at Amzad’s leaf plate from a distance. Holy Mother noticed this and said: “How can one enjoy food when it is served with such scorn? Let me wait on him properly.” After Amzad had finished his meal, Holy Mother cleaned the place where he had sat with her own hands. Nalini shrieked: “Aunt, you have lost your caste!” “Keep quiet,” the Mother scolded her.

Her example brought to life the words of Krishna: “I am the same towards all beings; to Me there is none hateful or dear. But those who worship Me with devotion—they are in Me, and I too am in them.” One morning in Jayrambati while the Mother was rubbing her body with oil, someone was sweeping the courtyard.

So, they declare that righteous work, purifying acts like sacrifice, austerity and charity should be performed. They ought not to be abandoned.

Sometimes we come across some philosophers and religious men who deny these acts on the ground that even good acts are a bondage and lead to further births. Their position is directly opposed to the Lord’s will. Righteous work of every kind is encouraged very frequently in the Gita. In this verse, the Lord warns not to abandon good acts like sacrifice, austerity and charity. He commands that they should be performed. Why should there be any doubt and why should man go down into lower planes by ignoring the Lord’s command?

Through such action one develops love and devotion to God, and ultimately realises Him. “The more you come to love God, the less you will be inclined to perform action. When the daughter-in-law is with child, her mother-in-law gives her less work to do. As time goes by she is given less and less work. When the time of delivery nears, she is not allowed to do any work at all, lest it should hurt the child or cause difficulty at the time of birth. “By these philanthropic activities you are really doing good to yourself. If you can do them disinterestedly, your mind will become pure and you will develop love of God. As soon as you have that love you will realise Him.

To renounce them by delusion is wrong. When the mind of the Jiva is overcast by the clouds of ignorance such thoughts like abandoning Sastraic injunctions come to him. The Lord has already declared that the Sastras are, the authority about what ought to be done and what ought not to be done (17-28). Whatever May be the cause, ignorance, negligence, or laziness abandoning the obligatory acts of the Sastras is Tamasic Tyaga. It is to be noted that formerly when the Lord has explained the threefold Yajna, Dana etc. he followed the order-Sattva, Rajas and Tamas. But here the order is reversed, and Tamasic Tyaga is first mentioned. The idea evidently is that the Lord wants first to condemn Tamasic and Rajasic Tyaga, before he comes to the sattvic type as the most worthy to be followed. Commentary by Swami Chetanananda",

He is lazy and the dullness of the body overpowers him, preventing him from doing the practices. It is true that action which is ultimately beneficial is at first difficult to follow. So, the man of weak will-power neglects it from sheer fear of bodily pain. He renounces them as useless or beyond his power to practice. To get up at the auspicious time of Brahmamuhurta (4 A.M.), taking a good bath in cold water in the river or from a well, practising the vow of celibacy, and such other methods may appear difficult in the beginning, but in the long run, they yield the highest reward of joy and happiness, health and strength. The Rajasic Tyagi is foregoing a great good for a slight cause. Such is the power of the flesh over the spirit. We find that every great man in any field has mastered the body and made it a simple instrument for useful work. To abandon obligatory duties on account of bodily pain is nothing short of sacrificing the spirit for the sake of the body. The Teacher",

Through maya one feels the Real to be the unreal and the unreal to be the Real. The Real means That which is eternal, the Supreme Brahman; and the unreal means that which is non-eternal, that is to say, the world.” DEVOTEE: “We read the scriptures. Why is it that we can’t assimilate them?” MASTER: “What will one accomplish by mere reading? One needs spiritual practice — austerity. Call on God. What is the use of merely repeating the word ‘siddhi’? One must eat a little of it. “The hand bleeds when it touches a thorny plant. Suppose you bring such a plant and repeat, sitting near",

Otherwise, man verily falls into the bottomless pit of ignorance. How can the man of Atmasakshatkara, who sees everything as Atma, who knows that he is not the doer, who is unattached, who is established in the self, and who looks upon all beings as his own Self, cause injury to others? Descending from the Atmic state, man identifies himself with the mind and body, and hence he gets bound by his own actions. Freed from this delusion, man knows that he is the Atma, the eternal actionless Self. fight the battle and slay the Kauravas, but do so knowing fully that you are not the personal agent of action, that you are in truth the Eternal Self. Thus here is the Lord’s reply to Arjuna’s original doubt – “How can I kill my own people ?” The freedom of Atma from all good and evil is the Truth. And yet, let it be firmly known that when the Atmajnani acts using the lower instruments, his actions are full of compassion for mankind. Here is the real test of Atmajnana. Let the aspirants bear this clearly in mind and test their knowledge by the purity of their thoughts and actions. Knowledge, devotion, compassion; and renunciation belong to the realm of vidya.

    "text": "It is declared here that the man who has no sense of doership (“I am doing this or that”), whose intellect is not contaminated by anything material, is not affected by evil though he slays all the beings in the world. This verse has to be understood correctly and interpreted very carefully. Otherwise, man verily falls into the bottomless pit of ignorance. The cause of Karmic bondage is the sense of doership and personal agency in all actions. The attachment of the deluded intellect to material objects is also the cause of bondage. When the false sense of agency and attachment are left behind, action has no power to bind man. Good and evil arising from action cannot affect man. This truth is declared here. It certainly does not mean that man can kill people and escape punishment. How can the man of Atmasakshatkara, who sees everything as Atma, who knows that he is not the doer, who is unattached, who is established in the self, and who looks upon all beings as his own Self, cause injury to others? He thinks and works for the well-being of all beings. He becomes ‘sarva bhutahiteratah’. If anybody thinks and acts otherwise,",

Thus he is not touched by actions performed by the intellect or the body. Therefore though he slays others, he is not the slayer. This Truth is declared emphatically. The Lord wants to emphasise the absolutely pure and perfect nature of Atma, which is independent of every phenomenal change. Good and evil arise from action done with a feeling of personal doership. Descending from the Atmic state, man identifies himself with the mind and body, and hence he gets bound by his own actions. Freed from this delusion, man knows that he is the Atma, the eternal actionless Self. There is no ‘punya’ or ‘papa’ for him. He has gone beyond good and evil. Any amount of good does not bind him, and so also no amount of evil can come to him. For that man the little ‘I’ is dead and gone, and so there is neither the doer nor the enjoyer.

The Lord says to the warrior-disciple, “O Arjuna! fight the battle and slay the Kauravas, but do so knowing fully that you are not the personal agent of action, that you are in truth the Eternal Self. Then you shall remain free”. Thus here is the Lord’s reply to Arjuna’s original doubt – “How can I kill my own people ?” The freedom of Atma from all good and evil is the Truth. Those who have reached that state have gone beyond both. And yet, let it be firmly known that when the Atmajnani acts using the lower instruments, his actions are full of compassion for mankind. His hands do only good work. His mind thinks only good thoughts. His lips speak only good words, benedictions for all. He acts, if he so desires, for the welfare of all beings. Here is the real test of Atmajnana. Evil cannot dare come anywhere near him. He is like the lion of whom the lower beasts are afraid and come not near. Let the aspirants bear this clearly in mind and test their knowledge",

Commentary by Swami Chetanananda Sri Ramakrishna Says — The Master was gradually regaining consciousness of the outer world. Looking at the devotees he said: “Years ago I used to be amazed to see people keeping kai fish alive in a pot of water. I would say: ‘How cruel these people are! They will finally kill the fish.’ But later, as changes came over my mind, I realised that bodies are like pillow-cases. It doesn’t matter whether they remain or drop off.” BHAVANATH: “Then may one injure a man without incurring sin? Kill him?” MASTER: “Yes, it is permissible if one has achieved that state of mind, But not everyone has it. It is the state of Brahmajnana. “By coming down a step or two from samadhi I enjoy bhakti and bhakta. “There exist in God both vidya and avidya. Vidyamaya leads one to God, and avidyamaya away from Him. Knowledge, devotion, compassion; and renunciation belong to the realm of vidya. With the help of these a man comes near God. One step more",

Likewise, in the state of Brahmajnana one sees God both within and without. One sees that it is God Himself who has become the body, mind, life, and soul.” M. ( to himself ): “Assimilation!” MASTER: “A man attains Brahmajnana as soon as his mind is annihilated. With the annihilation of the mind dies the ego, which says ‘I’, ‘I’. One also attains the Knowledge of Brahman by following the path of devotion. One also attains It by following the path of knowledge, that is to say, discrimination. The jnanis discriminate, saying, ‘Neti, neti’, that is, ‘All this is illusory, like a dream.’ They analyse the world through the process of ‘Not this, not this’; it is maya.

Here, four conditions are prescribed for the Sattvic agent. 1. He should be free from longing for the fruits of his work. This detachment enables the agent to maintain his freedom in the midst of the work he is doing. In fact, it is this spirit of freedom which is to be safeguarded at every turn in this course of earthly life. Freedom is the very essence of spiritual realisation. 2. The absence of the egotistic feeling ‘I am the doer; I am doing this or that is the second quality of the Sattvic agent. It is a clear perception that all action is performed only by the Gunas and the instruments of action. When a man attains this clearness of understanding, he is finally aware that he is not the real actor or agent. He has no egotistic feeling. He remains a witness of all that he is doing with his body, senses and mind. 3. The third attribute of the Sattvic agent is firmness and enthusiasm. Timidity and despondence have no place in the",

The pleasures of the body appear enjoyable to them, and the bliss of Atma has no relish for them; 3.

The mind, the vital forces, the external and internal instruments of the body, should be held, and controlled, by unswerving Yogic concentration. This is Sattvic Dhriti’. The yogi is determined to conquer the whole of the inner universe and keep it under his control. He draws the mind back from the innumerable temptations of the sense-enjoyment; he frees himself from the tremendous delusion of the objective universe. This is Sattvic courage and firmness. Besides worldly courage which helps man to overcome external difficulties and dangers, one should cultivate firmness of Yoga in the conquest of the internal forces. This courage should be unswerving, firm, and immovable. Therefore it is described as ‘ avyabhicharinya ‘. We see that the courage of renunciation is strong sometimes and weak at other times. It stays for some period and when its hold is",

He should strive to cultivate kindness, compassion, devotion, and knowledge, and acquire God’s grace. Sage Valmiki at first misused his faculties in evil ways.

Many people ask the question-“How can we realise Atma, transcend pain and suffering, and attain bliss”? The Lord answers the question here. “Practice, and you shall attain that state,” says the Lord. Nothing can be achieved by mere talk and mere study of books. You can get butter only by churning the curd. You can get sweet juice only by crushing the sugar cane. You can get oil only by crushing the seeds. Therefore, by practice alone man can come to the end of pain and attain bliss. Dukhantam cha nigacchati: This is the fundamental question for all living beings. Where is true joy and how is it to be attained? From the lowest germs and worms up to the creator Brahma, this question is asked, and the answer to this question is escaping mankind in spite of repeated efforts to find it.

To throw away the inherent divine bliss by fear of external discomforts would be very foolish. So, the seekers should constantly remind themselves of the pure bliss that awaits them when the initial obstacles are overcome by firm resistance, and indomitable will. One should be a hero on the spiritual path. The Upanishads declare that only a hero (Dhirah) can obtain the vision of Paramatma. The lives of Lord Buddha, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, and others reveal this truth. This Atmic bliss is not like the drink of the Gods which enables them to live longer than the mortals.

Moreover, the sense-pleasures, though they appear sweet and attractive on the surface, lead to pain, sorrow, and suffering in the end.

Man is deluded by the superficial glitter and glamour of sense attractions and rushes to his own destruction by running after them with foolish zeal and enthusiasm. Knowing it as such, who will pursue them? Who will love them? Who will hanker after them? The wise man takes the hint from the Lord’s command and abandons all unworthy ends and purpose in life. All that glitters is not gold. The glitter of sense-pleasures is easily understood even by an uncritical mind in the daily course of human life. What is necessary is to pause for a moment and enquire into the nature of such pleasure and its consequence. Such enquiry repeatedly carried out will enable the seeker to know the true nature of the sense pleasures, and when it is known the mind ceases to run after them.",

Here again, the Lord states that the difference among the castes is due to qualities differently exhibited according to their nature. So, the accident of birth is not the real criterion to fix the special gradation of the caste system. It shows that caste is no bar for anyone who aspires for Self-realisation. Though the birth is apparently in the lower castes, man can ascend to great spiritual heights by the purity of his character and conducts. The Gita thus throws open the gates of Brahmajnana to all people who are qualified for it by virtue of their inherent predispositions and acquired merit. The accident of birth is of very little significance. Commentary by Swami Chetanananda",

By such detached action, the mind is purified and the Self is realised. Thus Karma is the way to Atmajnana through the purification of the mind.

The duties of another man appear easy and attractive, but the true seeker should stick to his own method and way of life. This is certainly better than abandoning one’s own duty and taking up another’s and doing it even meritoriously. We have to refer this statement to Arjuna’s original plea to abandon fighting and to live the life of a mendicant. Arjuna is a Kshatriya and his duty born of his own nature is to fight. He should not give up this duty. He should perform it in the true spirit of a Karma-Yogi. By doing so, he does not incur sin. The principle holds good to all men engaged in various forms of work each according to his nature. The verse may be interpreted in another way. ‘Svadharma’ may be taken to mean Atma dharma’. To think of Atma and meditate on that may appear difficult, and living the life of the senses in the objective world may be easy. But the real seeker should continue the ‘Atma-dharma’ in spite of difficulties and failures. In fact,",

Commentary by Swami Chetanananda One should not condemn any method practised by a person who genuinely believes in his heart of hearts that it will enable him to realize God. The spiritual attitude of no one should be interfered with. For, if one rightly grasps any attitude, through it alone one can realize the divine Lord, who is the embodiment of all attitudes. Stick to your own attitude and continue calling on Him. But never condemn anybody’s attitude nor try to make another’s attitude your own. — Sri Ramakrishna (Source: Sri Ramakrishna The Great Master) —– The Master (Sri Ramakrishna) established relationships with devotees according to their natures. The Master established a particular spiritual relationship with each devotee based on that",

If a man imitated another person, going against his own nature by doing so, the Master would be displeased and would point out that man’s mistake. For example, he used to call Girish “Bhairava” [a form of Shiva]. One day at the Dakshineswar Kali temple when he was in ecstasy, he saw Girish in that form. He put up with Girish’s importunities and harsh words because he could see the wonderful tenderness and complete dependence hidden under the veil of his rough mannerisms. Once another devotee of the Master used that kind of rude language towards him, imitating Girish. The Master was very displeased and later pointed out his error.

While every medicine on the shelf is potent and valid in its own right, not every medicine is meant for you. If you are suffering from a fever, you must take the medicine prescribed for fever. To glance at another patient curing their cold with a different medicine, and then blindly consume that same medicine simply because it worked for them, is not only useless—it is dangerous. Similarly, in life, we each have a unique nature ( Svabhava ) and a specific duty born of that nature ( Svadharma ). To abandon your own natural duty to imitate the path of another—merely because it looks successful or attractive—is spiritual suicide. Just as the wrong medicine poisons the body, the wrong duty disturbs the soul. Even if the medicine meant for you tastes bitter (flawed/difficult), it cures you. The sweet syrup meant for someone else (perfectly performed alien duty) will only harm you. A doctor prescribes medication based on the patient’s specific constitution. In the same way, your duties are prescribed by your Svabhava (inner nature). Acting",

He who takes refuge in the Lord is not bound by any action or by all the actions done continually throughout his life. On the other hand, he breaks the bonds of Karma, for, the binding power of Karma is destroyed by true devotion to the Lord. There is no agency or selfish desire behind such work.

Now the Lord points out that even if Arjuna resolves to give up action, he cannot do so, for reason that his own nature will compel him to fight against his own resolve not to do so. The great secret behind all action is the sense of non-doership (i.e.) the absence of agency, in the doer. Man must act some way or other by the force of his nature and habit. How then can he be free from the binding effects of his action? The answer is this-By giving up the sense of doership, and renouncing the fruits of action he can be free. This is the essential secret behind all action. One who has attained this feeling of detachment is not bound by anything that he does. Swami Vivekananda Says — First form character, first earn spirituality and results will come of themselves. [Source] ”Each man’s character is determined by the sum total of these impressions. If good impressions prevail, the character becomes good; if bad, it becomes bad. If a man continuously hears bad words, thinks bad thoughts,",

[Source] One day Sri Ramakrishna wrote on a piece of paper, “Naren will teach people.” When Narendra(Swami Vivekananda) expressed opposition the Master said: “But you must. Your very bones will do it.” The scripture says: Vāsanā pushyati vapuh, desires preserve the body. Human beings have innumerable desires and they force people to move forward. Most people are satisfied when they have fulfilled their worldly desires, and only a rare one among millions seeks God. Chandra Mohan Datta, a young man from Dhaka, came to Calcutta for a job. He heard about the Ramakrishna Mission and came to Udbodhan House, where he met Holy Mother. She listened to him describe his family background and appointed him to do marketing for her household. Saradananda also engaged him to pack books in the publication department. The Mother was very fond of him, because of his simplicity, honesty, and guilelessness. He lived with the monks on the ground floor of the house. He was very fond of eating, and the Mother loved to feed him. Whenever he came to her, he got something to eat.

Among millions, perhaps, one would ask for liberation. Chandra Datta once faced this test. He recalled: Once I was about to go for a bath in the Ganges from Udbodhan House. Swamis Shuddhananda and Prajnananda were with me. Suddenly Swami Shuddhananda said to me: “Chandra, you have free access to Holy Mother and she is also very fond of you. Could you go to the Mother and ask something that I tell you?” “Of course, I can. Tell me what I have to ask from her.” “Nothing much. It is a trivial thing. Just tell her, ‘Mother, I want liberation.’” “I shall tell her right now.” Immediately I ran to the Mother’s room upstairs and found her worshipping the Master. I had come to her room so many times before, but on that day I was a little scared to see her performing worship. My body began to tremble. I was thinking I should leave the room but I did not have that strength. My legs were shaking, my",

Again she asked with a sign, “Did you come to say something?” Quite involuntarily I blurted out one word, “prasad.” The Mother pointed to the prasad kept on a plate under the bed. Then she resumed the worship. Shivering and perspiring profusely, I ran downstairs with the prasad and found that both swamis were waiting for me anxiously. Swami Shuddhananda asked: “Well, Chandra, could you ask for liberation? What did the Mother say?” I told them what happened. I could not go to the Ganges that day and it took many hours to calm down. Unable to find a permanent solution to the financial problems of his family, Narendra(Swami Vivekananda) went to the Master one day and asked him to pray to the Divine Mother on his behalf, as Narendra had faith that She listened to the Master’s prayers. The Master told him to go to the temple and pray to Her himself for help, assuring him that his request would be granted. Narendra went to the temple with great anticipation. But as soon",

Grant that I may have an uninterrupted vision of Thee!” He went back to the Master and told him what had happened.The Master sent Narendra to the temple to pray again, but the same thing happened.

It is the most foolish delusion of man to think that the Lord is far away, somewhere in the remote sky, and at some such place where man cannot reach. This way of thinking has become a habit of mind for all mankind, except for a very few wise men, who know the secret. The Lord is not away from us. He is with us, in us right in our own heart. That is the Lord’s declaration. He dwells in the heart of all beings, and so one should be very careful in his thought and deeds. He sees all. He is the all-pervasive Atman. He is the dispenser of rewards and punishments for each and every being, according to his Punya and Papa Karma Therefore man should feel the presence of the Lord within and without and try his best to avoid evil and cling to the good only. People must follow the path of truth and righteousness, for, the Lord sees all by His invisible presence everywhere. The Lord’s declaration should inspire hope to the devotee. Where else is he to go to",

He is equally present in all, in the sinner as well as in the saint. His presence is felt more where the heart is pure. The difference is only in the degree of manifestation.

The answer is given in this verse. To surrender with all his being, whole-heartedly to the Lord who dwells in all beings is the only way to attain freedom from the shackles of Samsara. If anybody wants to stop a machine he must seek the help of the mechanic. The Lord is the mechanic who holds and runs the tremendous machine of Samsara. Therefore Jiva has to take refuge in the Lord if he wants liberation. Without whole-hearted surrender to the Lord, the power of Maya will not give way. Only the power of the Lord is capable of terminating the power of Maya. To none else will Maya give way. Therefore the Lord advises Arjuna to surrender to Him with all his being. This exhortation is for all beings. It is the simplest and easiest path for everyone to follow. All physical powers are subject to the power of Maya and Maya is subject to the power of the Lord. Knowing this, man has to give",

This is one of the central ideas of the Scripture. That the idea of surrender is emphasised in the last verses of the scripture is sufficient proof that it is the major current of thought throughout. Arjuna surrendered to the Lord before the message of Gita is offered to him. The idea is once again brought into a focal point at the end. Sarvabha-vena: With all his being (i.e.) body, mind and speech. It means that surrender should be complete and unconditional. The whole responsibility is given over to the Lord. The difficulty for the common man is that his surrender generally is conditioned by a secret and silent demand. It is not unreserved. Man’s faith is generally half-hearted. He doubts the mercy of the Lord. He partly wishes to do things by himself, although his life’s experience shows that he has not obtained any great advantage by his own effort.

Arjuna was qualified to receive it by virtue of his great devotion to Krishna, and the virtuous qualities (Daivisampat) that he possessed. Lord Krishna has thereby done a great service to mankind. Even for learning any worldly skill or art, a great deal of preparation is necessary for the student. When that is so, what amount of internal and external preparation is necessary for receiving this highest wisdom, one can easily understand. So the Lord declares that he has taught the most secret wisdom to Arjuna, just because he is fit to receive it, and finds it most necessary in the circumstances in which he is placed. Vimrisyaita daseshena: Fully reflecting over it. It is the practice of all great teachers to give all that the disciple wants by way of teaching and instruction, and finally leave it to the disciple to decide what he should do, and how he should act.

We see in this context how broad-minded the Lord was when he left the freedom of choice to Arjuna himself. Arjuna was one of the greatest devotees of Krishna. Krishna’s word was law unto him. If Lord Krishna wanted Arjuna to fight in the form of a command, Arjuna would have immediately acted up without any hesitation. But the Lord takes a different view. After giving the full message of wisdom, the Lord asks Arjuna to reflect over it, think well and deeply, and come to a voluntary decision. Such a decision would ultimately benefit him much more than a mere verbal command from the teacher. The final decision is left entirely to the individual. Yadhecchasi tadha Kuru: Act as you wish.

That is your decision, not mine. I have taught you the essence of all the Vedas, and it is your duty in the present situation, to take it or leave it. I am unconcerned”.

Four types of spiritual discipline are pointed out here (1) Fixing the mind on God, (2) Devotion to God, (3) Performing sacrifice unto God. (4) Humble prostration to God. Such discipline leads to the highest realisation, namely, union with God. Therefore those who seek knowledge should reject all the temptations of the flesh. They should fix their mind on God and love God with the same zeal and attraction as they feel for the objects of the senses. They should bow to God in utter humility. They should meditate on God with a full heart. The ignorant unfortunately run after sensual pleasures and distract their minds with a hundred petty desires and longings. They miss the way and are lost in darkness. They have strayed away from the path of true happiness. They cannot realise the bliss of union with God. Sattyam",

Commentary by Swami Chetanananda Swami Turiyananda: “If the Lord is ever present inside and outside, then with what object should you undergo austerities? And if He be not inside and outside, of what avail are these austerities ?’ In other words, we must go through them, betaking ourselves to God. In our country, however, there is now a sad dearth of austerities. One no more hears nowadays of rigid austerities as of old. Well, this is the result of undigested Vedanta. Is it possible to understand the truths of Vedanta without undergoing austerities? Vicharasâgara is a misnomer now. Pseudo-Vedantism has spoilt the country. They simply talk big-‘He only exists, “The universe is non-existent, in the past, present, as well as in the future,’ and so on. Nonsense! Do they mean anything by all that? Vedanta cannot be",

Parthasyacha mahatmanah: Arjuna was in a state of ignorance like any other mortal. He now becomes a Mahatma after gaining Atma-Jnana by the message of the Gita. Everybody can become a Mahatma by sincere effort. The aim of the Gita is to raise the degraded mortal to the status of a Mahatma. The ignorant man becomes wise, the man of fear becomes a hero, and the doubter gains firm conviction, by the teaching of the Gita. Adbhutam romaharshnam: Sanjaya was filled with a feeling of wonder and his hair stood on end when he heard the divine dialogue between Krishna and Arjuna. Just as the nectar confers longevity on mortal man, just as baser metals are transformed into gold by the touch of Sparsavedi, so also the message of the Gita frees the bound soul from delusion and ignorance, and man attains Atma-Jnana. Sanjaya is in a state of ecstasy. It shows that everybody when he hears the Gita will be filled with great joy like Sanjaya. Bhagavad Gita 18.74 to 18.77 by Swami Chetanananda",
